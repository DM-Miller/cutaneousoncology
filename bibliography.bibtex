    abstract = "{Structured real-world data (RWD), such as those found in cancer registries, provide a rich source of information regarding the natural history of cancer. Interactive data visualizations of cancer lesions can provide insights into certain clinical tumor characteristics (CTC). Software that can be integrated into an oncological data collection effort and generate anatomical data visualizations of CTC are limited.We created BodyMapR: an R package and Shiny application that generates anatomical visualizations of cancer lesions from structured data.BodyMapR is a Shiny application that transposes structured data from REDCap¬Æ onto an anatomical map to yield an interactive data visualization.BodyMapR is freely available under the MIT license and can be obtained from GitHub. BodyMapR is executed in R and deployed as a Shiny application. It can be integrated into an existing cancer research platform and produces an interactive data visualization of CTC.Large-scale data collection efforts in rare cancers are challenging and uncommon. Consequently, we lack a comprehensive understanding of clinical tumor characteristics (CTC), such as patterns of metastatic spread and biomarkers predictive of treatment response, for most rare tumors. Data collection efforts that incorporate data captured during real-world practice (a.k.a real-world data) can improve our understanding of CTC. Depicting RWD, for example, from a cancer registry, onto graphical representations of anatomical structures can provide a user-friendly technique to process information regarding CTC. However, displaying large amounts of RWD onto anatomical data visualizations is labor-intensive and time consuming. Currently, there is a dearth of software that can facilitate this process. Here, we present BodyMapR, a novel software that generates an interactive visualization of CTC from RWD. The package is freely available and modifiable by end users.}",

However, these data often reside in heterogeneous and semistructured data, resulting in prolonged time-to-analyses.We created GENETEX: an R package and Shiny application for text mining genomic reports from electronic health record (EHR) and direct import into Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap).GENETEX facilitates the abstraction of CGD from EHR and streamlines the capture of structured data into REDCap. Its functions include natural language processing of key genomic information, transformation of semistructured data into structured data, and importation into REDCap. When evaluated with manual abstraction, GENETEX had \\&gt;99\\% agreement and captured CGD in approximately one-fifth the time.GENETEX is freely available under the Massachusetts Institute of Technology license and can be obtained from GitHub (https://github.com/TheMillerLab/genetex). GENETEX is executed in R and deployed as a Shiny application for non-R users. It produces high-fidelity abstraction of CGD in a fraction of the time.}",

    abstract = "{To develop a clinical informatics pipeline designed to capture large-scale structured Electronic Health Record (EHR) data for a national patient registry.The EHR-R-REDCap pipeline is implemented using R statistical software to remap and import structured EHR data into the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap)-based multi-institutional Merkel Cell Carcinoma (MCC) Patient Registry using an adaptable data dictionary.Clinical laboratory data were extracted from EPIC Clarity across several participating institutions. Laboratory values (Labs) were transformed, remapped, and imported into the MCC registry using the EHR labs abstraction (eLAB) pipeline. Forty-nine clinical tests encompassing 482¬†450 results were imported into the registry for 1109 enrolled MCC patients. Data-quality assessment revealed highly accurate, valid labs. Univariate modeling was performed for labs at baseline on overall survival (N‚Äâ=‚Äâ176) using this clinical informatics pipeline.We demonstrate feasibility of the facile eLAB workflow. EHR data are successfully transformed and bulk-loaded/imported into a REDCap-based national registry to execute real-world data analysis and interoperability.Healthcare data collected during routine clinical care in patient electronic health records (EHRs) can be curated and organized into disease-focused registries. For example, the Merkel Cell Carcinoma Patient Registry is a multi-institutional national database that utilizes real-world health care data to inform best practices, improve patient outcomes, and test hypotheses that require large data samples. However, many challenges arise when capturing patient-level details/data from the health records especially when this data must be aggregated across multiple institutions. Here, we describe a pipeline that (1)pulls large-scale data from the EHRs, (2)wrangles and remaps the data in a format appropriate for the database using R statistical software, and (3)imports the data in bulk for thousands of patients at a time into Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap), the electronic data capture system that houses the data. The EHR-R-REDCap pipeline can be utilized to capture many patient data features from the participating institutions. Here, we demonstrate eLAB, the EHR-R-REDCap pipeline utilized by our Merkel Cell Carcinoma Patient Registry to capture thousands of laboratory values from the EHR for thousands of patients. We provide source code, examples, and instructions for adaptability for other clinical research projects that aim to collect large-scale laboratory data from the EHR.}",

	abstract = {Non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) is the most frequently diagnosed malignancy in humans, representing a broad range of cutaneous tumors. Keratinocyte carcinomas, including basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC), are the most common NMSCs. The incidence of BCC and CSCC are steadily increasing due to a progressively aging population, chronic exposure to ultraviolet radiation, and increased awareness with earlier diagnosis. Rarer NMSCs such as Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) and cutaneous adnexal carcinomas (CACs) are also on the rise. Although the majority of NMSC tumors are localized at diagnosis and managed effectively with curative surgery and radiation, in rare cases with nodal and distant metastases, systemic therapy is often required. As our understanding of the immunologic characteristics of NMSCs has improved, effective treatment options have expanded with the development of immunotherapy. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently approved several immune checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of locally advanced and metastatic MCC, CSCC, and BCC. We review the emerging role of immunotherapy as the standard of care for several advanced NMSCs not amenable to surgery and/or radiation and underscore the need for considering clinical trials of novel strategies in patients when immunotherapy does not provide durable benefit. Finally, we explore the potential of neoadjuvant and adjuvant immunotherapy.},
