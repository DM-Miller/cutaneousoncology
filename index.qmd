The Society of Cutaneous Oncology (SoCO) is a collective of clinicians and investigators committed to improving outcomes in patients with skin cancer. Our mission is threefold: 1) to interpret evidence to help shape best practices, 2) to support members in producing high-quality reproducible science, and 3) educate future generations of clinical oncologists and scientific investigators dedicated to skin cancer. To fulfill those objectives the SoCO: 1) is the publisher of [Journal of Cutaneous Oncology (JoCO)](https://journalofcutaneousoncology.io), an open access journal whose scope is specific to skin cancer, 2) hosts a recurring monthly journal club and 3) supports an open forum for research discussions and presentations that convenes several times per year.
