Kim et al. Lancet 2022 Sep 24;400(10357):1008-1019. PMID: 36108657\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nOn November 7th, 2022, the multi-institutional Cutaneous Oncology Interest Group Journal Club reviewed the recently published Lancet article “Combined Nivolumab and Ipilimumab with or without Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy for Advanced Merkel cell carcinoma: A Randomised, Open Label, Phase 2 Trial”. Kim et al. (2022) Participants included clinicians and investigators from Massachusetts General Hospital, Mass Eye and Ear Infirmary, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, University of Washington School of Medicine, the National Institute of Health, Northwestern University, University of Pennsylvania and Moffitt Cancer Center. Importantly, the comments in this article represent the views of the authors of this Perspectives on the Science piece after the Journal Club. It does not represent views of any other members of the Interest Group or the affiliated institutions. In this article we provide a summary of the discussion regarding this important contribution to the literature. Of note, one participant of the Journal Club is an investigator of the discussed study and an author on the Lancet article.\n\n\nBackground for the Study\nMerkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare cutaneous neuroendocrine carcinoma often associated with chronic ultraviolet light exposure, a suppressed or weakened immune system, and/or the Merkel Cell Polyoma Virus (MCPyV). This aggressive skin cancer has a high distant metastasis rate, associated with a poor prognosis.\nThe advent of immunotherapeutics and the regulatory approvals of anti-PD-L1 and anti-PD-1 agents for MCC have revolutionized the treatment landscape. Avelumab received an accelerated FDA approval for metastatic MCC in 2017. Pembrolizumab was approved by the FDA in 2018 for the treatment of recurrent, locally advanced, and metastatic MCC. Immunotherapy is associated with durable responses in MCC and pivotal trials reported an objective response rate (ORR) of 39.7% (95% CI 30.7-49.2) for avelumab in the first line setting and an ORR of 33% (95% CI 23.3–43.8) in the chemotherapy-refractory setting. Kaufman et al. (2016) , D’Angelo et al. (2021) , D’Angelo et al. (2020) . An ORR of 58% (95% CI 43.2–71.8) was observed with pembrolizumab in the first line setting. Nghiem et al. (2016) While anti-PD-L1 and anti-PD-1 monotherapy have been established as the standard of care for the treatment of advanced MCC, there are few systemic therapy options for those patients who have primary or acquired resistance and fail anti-PD(L)-1 treatment. Therefore, evaluating combination ipilimumab with nivolumab in patients who progress on anti-PD(L)-1 monotherapy as well as immunotherapy-naïve patients with MCC is warranted. Finally, since MCC is exceptionally radiosensitive and subablative hypofractionated radiotherapy may prime for anti-tumor immune responses, assessing combination ipilimumab with nivolumab in immunotherapy-naïve and refractory patients with or without the addition of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is worthy of investigation. Demaria, Golden, and Formenti (2015)\n\n\nStudy Design\n\nThis study received funding from the company and patients were enrolled from the Moffitt Cancer Center and Ohio State University James Cancer Hospital & Solove Research Institute. The investigators conducted an open-label, Phase II study with eligible patients randomized (1:1) to Group A or B, two experimental groups. Group A was designed to evaluate the clinical efficacy of combination ipilimumab plus nivolumab (Ipi/Nivo) in patients with unresectable, recurrent, or stage IV MCC and Group B was designed to determine the clinical efficacy of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) with combination Ipi/Nivo. Patients were stratified as ICI-naïve or following previous ICI failure (See Figure 1).\nSubjects were administered 240 mg intravenous (IV) nivolumab every 2 weeks and IV ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks. Patients randomized to Group B also received SBRT to a minimum of one tumor/lesion site at a dose of 24 Gy (3 fractions). The primary endpoint was the ORR in all eligible randomized patients per immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (irRECIST). See the tables below for key inclusion and exclusion criteria and secondary and exploratory endpoints.\n\n\n\n\nMain Findings\nResponses were observed in 18/25 (72%) of the subjects enrolled in Group A and 12/23 (52%) of the Group B patients. No statistically significant difference was reported between the two experimental groups (p value = 0.26). Analysis of the pooled ‘ICI-naïve’ versus ‘previous-ICI’ cohorts showed that 100% (95% CI 82-100; 22/22 subjects) of the ICI-naïve patients experienced an objective response while only 31% (95% CI 15-52; 8/26 subjects) of the previous-ICI patients had an objective response. Reported adverse events (AEs) were attributed to combination Ipi/Nivo with minimal SBRT-AEs observed. Any-Grade AEs occurred in 90% (40/50) of the subjects and Grade III/IV AEs were reported in 40% (10/25) of Group A patients and 32% ( 8/25) of Group B patients.\n\n\nDiscussion Points\nWe began Journal Club on November 7th, 2022 by administering a poll among the attendees via poll everywhere. Our goal was to conduct a brief survey before and after journal club discussions to determine the current practices of clinicians participating in the dialogue and whether review/discussion of the article would be ‘practice-changing.’ The following reflects the survey results of the poll administered at the start of the meeting:\n\n\n\n\nThe following reflects the survey results of the poll after our discussion and article review:\n\n\nSurvey results demonstrate that upon review and discussion of the article, the study is indeed “practice-changing” among the Cutaneous Oncology Interest Group Journal Club attendees. According to the poll, the vast majority of participants were not administering Ipi/Nivo for advanced MCC a year ago, and have never administered Ipi/Nivo as a first-line therapy for MCC. The post-discussion survey shows the majority of participants will change their treatment recommendations for MCC after review of the article, and are more likely now to recommend Ipi/Nivo in light of the data/results of the phase II trial. With an ORR of 100% in the ICI-naive cohort, potentially administering Ipi/Nivo in the first-line may be a reasonable management option moving forward. However, we must continue to weigh potential risks in the setting of increased toxicity with combination ICI versus monotherapy anti-PD(L)-1. Below, a table of the Grade III+ reported AEs from the avelumab, and pembrolizumab pivotal trials are listed alongside the grade III/IV AEs described in this study. Of note, the dosing regimen utilized in both Group A and B differs from that recommended for melanoma. Ipi was administered every 6 weeks at 1mg/kg with nivo every 2 weeks at 240mg and demonstrated clinical efficacy in MCC. This may likely be associated with reduced toxicity comparable to other dosing regimens, but appears higher than anti-PD(L)-1 mono therapy. However, direct comparisons across the trials with different numbers of enrolled patients and duration of therapies is cautioned (see Table below).\n\nA favored suggestion amongst the group for future directions included a multi-center, randomized clinical trial evaluating monotherapy anti-PD(L)-1 versus Ipi/Nivo (first-line) for advanced MCC, to assess efficacy and toxicity differences across the different regimens. That said, participants acknowledged that large comparative trials remain difficult to conduct in rare diseases such as MCC. Indeed, the two therapies approved in MCC (avelumab and pembrolizumab) came via single arm, non-comparative studies, with overall limited sample sizes (n = 88 and n = 50, respectively). In this context, the question of whether the present study should be sufficient for additional labeling information for ipilimumab and nivolumab was raised. When viewed in the backdrop of the evolving regulatory landscape on cutaneous oncology, the current study shares many of the features of recent studies that have led to label modifications in skin cancer Miller et al. (2022) . For example, an analysis of the evidence used to support labeled claims in skin cancer from 1949 to February 09, 2021 demonstrated that the most common endpoint incorporate some form of tumor response, such as ORR, used by Kim et al. Interestingly, the present study demonstrated a response rate that surpassed any previously reported BLA or NDA-enabling study. Of the 30 labeling modifications supported by results of studies incorporating tumor response, the observed ORR ranged from 15.9-83.3%, with a median of 34%Miller et al. (2022). In the first-line setting, Ipi/Nivo resulted in responses in an awe-inspiring 100% of patients. Furthermore, although limited in sample size, 50 enrolled subjects is also comparable to many studies supporting efficacy labelling modifications in skin cancer. There have been 62 studies with less than 100 subjects and 8 studies with 50 or fewer (range = 12-1127)Miller et al. (2022). In our opinion, the data presented by Kim et al. unequivocally establishes activity of ipilimumab/nivolumab in MCC. Moreover, the risk profile is appropriate for the disease context and observed efficacy. Given the importance of product labels in both informing clinicians and insurance coverage, the authors support a consideration of this data by the agency for a supplemental accelerated approval label of ipilimumab/nivolumab for advanced MCC in the first-line setting.\nIn the second-line setting, the study also provides rationale that Ipi/Nivo administered earlier in the course of the disease may offer more benefit. For example, a recent retrospective study (N=13) assessing real-world outcomes of Ipi/Nivo in ICI-refractory patients had an ORR of 0% but the majority of patients had an ECOG PS > 1 with advanced stage disease. Shalhout et al. (2022) . In the wake of an ORR of 31% in the phase II trial among the previous-ICI cohort, perhaps Ipi/Nivo up-front may become the standard of care for advanced MCC. Additional real-world studies, although limited by confounding and bias, may provide important supportive evidence of this claim.

    "text": "Background for the Study\n\n\n\nThe therapeutic landscape in melanoma has evolved significantly since the first approval in 1967, with 48 US FDA actions for therapies indicated for the adjuvant, locally advanced and metastatic setting (D. M. Miller et al. (2022)) (Figure 1) .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1 - FDA Approvals in Melanoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the number of therapeutic options have increased, patients with macroscopic nodal metastases have a risk of melanoma-specific mortality that can approximate 75% (Gershenwald et al. (2017)). Recent strategies to improve outcomes in this high-risk subset of patients includes peri-operative administration of therapies previously shown to have efficacy in the locally advanced and unresectable setting. Post-operative monotherapy anti-PD1 has been shown to decrease the risk of recurrence by as much as 50% (Weber et al. (2017); Eggermont et al. (2018)). These studies led to the FDA-approval of nivolumab for resected Stage III disease in 2017 and pembrolizumab in 2019 (Figure 2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2 - FDA Approved Agents for Resected Melanoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPre-operative administration of systemic therapy has the potential to improve clinical outcomes by expanding antigen-specific immune response in the setting of an in situ tumor and preserved lymphatics (Liu et al. (2016)). Indeed, recently presented data at the 2022 Congress of the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) demonstrated the superiority of combining pre-operative with post-operative anti-PD1 compared to adjuvant-only anti-PD1 (Patel et al. (2022)). In the phase 2 study SWOG S1801, 313 patients with Stage IIIB-IV melanoma were randomized to either 3 doses of pre-operative pembrolizumab followed by 15 doses of adjuvant pembrolizumab or upfront surgery followed by 18 doses of post-operative pembrolizumab. Neoadjuvant plus adjuvant pembrolizumab was associated with a significantly higher event-free survival (EFS) (HR 0.59, 95% CI, 0.40-0.86) versus adjuvant-only therapy. In addition to potentially improving outcomes compared to post-operative-only therapy, by intensifying upfront treatment with neoadjuvant therapy, clinicians can utilize pathological information gained at the time of surgery to tailor post-operative management. The optimal neoadjuvant strategy, however, has not been identified; though several approaches have been evaluated. In a phase 2 study of 23 patients, ipilimumab plus nivolumab was compared to monotherapy nivolumab in the neoadjuvant setting (Amaria et al. (2018)) (Figure 3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3 - Neoadjuvant Ipi/Nivo vs. Nivolumab Study Design\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough limited in size, the study’s results suggested that three doses of ipilimumab 3 mg/kg plus nivolumab 1 mg/kg was associated with significant clinical activity, producing a complete pathological response (pCR) in 45% of patients. Despite not being adequately powered for comparison, the response seen with dual immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) appeared higher than with 4 doses of monotherapy anti-PD1 (pCR 25%). Combination Ipi/Nivo, however, resulted in grade 3-4 treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in 73% of patients.\nIn the OpACIN study, the combination of ipilimumab 3 mg/kg and nivolumab 1 mg/kg administered over two doses prior to surgery produced a pathological response in 7/9 (78%) patients, with 3/9 (33%) demonstrating a complete response (Blank et al. (2018))(Figure 4). Similar to the previous study, TEAEs were seen in 100% of patients, with 90% of patients experiencing grade 3-4 toxicity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4 - OpACIN Study Design\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an effort to identify the optimal combination dosing schedule of dual ICB, investigators of the OpACIN-neo study randomly assigned 105 patients to one of three combination regimens: Group A patients received two cycles of every three week (q3 week) ipilimumab 3 mg/kg plus nivolumab 1 mg/kg (Ipi 3/Nivo 1); Group B patients received two cycles of q3 week ipilimumab 1 mg/kg plus nivolumab 3 mg/kg (Ipi 1/Nivo 3) ; and Group C patients received two cycles of q3 week ipilimumab 3 mg/kg followed by two cycles of q2 week nivolumab 3 mg/kg (Ipi 3 followed by Nivo 3) (Rozeman et al. (2019)) (Figure 5). Recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates were similar between the 86 patients who were enrolled in the three groups, while grade 3-4 AEs were lower in the Ipi 1/Nivo 3 cohort (20%) compared to Ipi 3/Nivo 1 (40%) and the Ipi 3 followed by Nivo 3 (50%).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5 - OpACIN-neo Study Design\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven the favorable risk/benefit findings of Ipi 1/Nivo 3, an expansion cohort of OpACIN-neo was enrolled to investigate the role of assessing pathologic response in the index lymph node (ILN) in determining post-operative management (Figure 6). This study, named the PRADO Trial (Personalized response-directed surgery and adjuvant therapy after neoadjuvant ipilimumab and nivolumab in high-risk stage III melanoma), found that two pre-operative doses of Ipi 1/Nivo 3 yielded a 72% pathological response (PR) rate (49% pCR, 12% near-pCR, 11% partial PR).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6 - PRADO Study Design\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantly, patients that achieved a major pathological response (MPR, ≤10% viable tumor cells) and no further treatment had a recurrence-free survival (RFS) of 93% at 2 years compared to 64% for subjects that were pathological non-responders that went on to have a total lymph node dissection (TLND) and adjuvant systemic therapy. These results support the importance and role of pathological response assessment following upfront immunotherapy in post-operative management decisions, including the potential for de-escalation of therapy for patients with excellent pathological responses.\nAlthough there are no therapies with labelled indications in the neoadjuvant setting, these studies support the clinical utility of pre-operative immune checkpoint blockade (Table 1). Given the favorable responses seen with neoadjuvant treatment, the aforementioned clinical trials highlight the goal of continued investigation to find new approaches that augment immunological anti-tumor responses and minimize off-target autoimmunity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1 - Summary of Neoadjuvant Studies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudy\nPre-Operative Intervention\nPathological Response\nAny Grade AE\nGrade 3-4 AE\n\n\n\n\nOpACIN Blank et al.

Activation of LAG-3 attenuates T-cell activity (Figure 7).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7 - Immune Checkpoint Pathways\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn March 18, 2022, Relatlimab-rmbw, a first-in-class human IgG4 LAG-3-blocking monoclonal antibody, was approved in combination with nivolumab (Nivo/Rela) by the US FDA for unresectable or metastatic melanoma. Approval was based on data from the phase 2-3 study RELATIVITY-047, in which combination Nivo/Rela was associated with improved progression-free survial (PFS) compared to single-agent nivolumab (10.12 vs. 4.63 months, HR 0.75 (95% CI, 0.62 - 0.92)) (Tawbi et al. (2022)). Compared to nivolumab monotherapy, Nivo/Rela was associated with a higher, but overall reasonable safety profile. Any grade toxicity was seen in 97.2% of patients treated with combination therapy vs. 94.4% single-agent nivolumab. Grade 3-4 AEs were seen in 40.3% of patients who received Nivo/Rela vs. 33.4% of those administered nivolumab monotherapy. Based on the improved PFS and acceptable safety profile seen in RELATIVITY-047, the OpACIN-neo investigators opened a new arm of NCT02519322 to evaluate the pCR rate, safety and efficacy of peri-operative Nivo/Rela."

    "text": "Discussion Points\nWe began Journal Club by administering a poll among the attendees. Our goal was to conduct a brief survey before and after journal club discussions to determine the current practices of clinicians participating in the dialogue and how the current article might affect their practice. The attendees on December 2nd, 2022 represented a diverse mix of clinical providers and non-clinical researchers (Figure 9).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9 - Journal Club Attendees\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to begin a conversation about the evolving approach to resectable melanoma, attendees were queried as to how they would have likely managed a case of Stage IIIC melanoma, one year ago (Figure 10). Options included surgery only, surgery and adjuvant therapy, as well as pre-operative systemic therapy followed by a tailored post-operative approach based on the pathologic response seen on resection. Due to diverse nature of the COIG, nine respondents felt comfortable making a treatment recommendation for regionally metastatic melanoma (7 members did not). All nine clinicians (100%) replied that 1-year ago they would have recommended surgery followed by adjuvant anti-PD1. None of the respondents would have utilized a neoadjuvant approach.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10 - Management Strategies of Stage IIIC Melanoma 1-Year Ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven the topic of the current paper, we surveyed how many clinicians had previously recommended the use of neoadjuvant immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) for resectable melanoma. Of the 8 respondents, 75% responded that they had incorporated pre-operative ICI into at least one patient’s treatment strategy (Figure 11).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11 - Use of Neoadjuvant Immunotherapy for Resectable Melanoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe majority of clinicians (5/8), however, had not previously recommended neoadjuvant Ipi/Nivo for resectable melanoma (Figure 12). Concern for significant toxicity was cited as a common reason for not incorporating Ipi/Nivo into a neoadjuvant management plan for high-risk, but resectable melanoma. That said, clinicians in the group acknowledged the potential of neoadjuvant strategies to enhance pathologic responses and improve long-term outcomes while improving on the toxicity profile seen with neoadjuvant Ipi/Nivo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12 - Use of Neoadjuvant Ipi/Nivo for Resectable Melanoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the current study was fairly limited in size (n = 30), there was a generally favorable response to its outcomes and toxicity data. Similar to what was observed in previous neoadjuvant studies, pathological response to neoadjuvant treatment was associated with a significantly improved RFS rate at 2 years (92% vs. 55%). Thus, pathologic response likely serves as an early indicator of long-term outcome. However, unlike the PRADO study, however, all patients received post-operative adjuvant Nivo/Rela. Therefore, a follow up study will be necessary to learn if pathologic response can be used to de-escalate post-surgical therapy. Given that all of the grade 3-4 AEs to Nivo/Rela occurred in the post-operative setting, omission of adjuvant immunotherapy may preclude serious toxicity.\nDespite the limitations of the current study (e.g. small cohort, non-randomized design), the COIG participants who treat melanoma indicated that these data would affect their current practice. The vast majority (88%) replied that this paper would change their practice (Figure 13).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13 - Practice Impact of “Neoadjuvant relatlimab and nivolumab in resectable melanoma”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen presented with the same clinical example as above (BRAF wild type, T3bN1bM0 scalp melanoma) 6/7 of the respondents answered that they would now recommend neoadjuvant Nivo/Rela (Figure 14). Despite the fact that 1 year ago, NCT02519322, OpACIN and OpACIN-neo had been published, none of the clinicians responded that they would have incorporated neoadjuvant therapy in the Stage IIIC melanoma vignette. There are likely several factors that underlie this change in approach to the management of resectable melanoma. Over the last year several studies have been either presented (SWOG S1801) or published (PRADO, the current study) supporting the clinical utility of pre-operative immune therapy for resectable disease. Furthermore, similar data supporting the use of neoadjuvant ICI have been demonstrated in other skin cancers such as Merkel cell carcinoma Topalian et al. (2020) and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. Gross et al. (2022) Since the majority of the practioners present at the meeting also manage patients with non-melanoma skin cancer, they are aware of the body of evidence in skin cancer supporting pre-operative ICI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14 - Current Approach to Stage IIIC Melanoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticipants acknowledged the challenges in selecting a management strategy for resectable melanoma, given the promising results of several small neoadjuvant investigation, with varying treatment approaches. Currently, clinicians have a variety of options including on-label post-operative anti-PD1 monotherapy and off-label upfront therapy with single-agent anti-PD1 or dual ICB with anti-PD1/anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD1/anti-LAG-3 combinations. The safety profile may be more important in considering neoadjuvant therapy, and the safety profile reported in the small cohort of this paper suggests a more favorable safety signal than anti-PD-1/anti-CTLA4 combinations. Consequently, there is a critical need for a randomized, comparative study to help evaluate which of the various strategies yields the optimal clinical benefit. However, until those studies are performed, clinicians must choose which of the following management approaches will best serve their current patients. Based on the efficacy and toxicity data from this study relative to the existing data (Table 2),\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2 - Neoadjuvant Study Summary Updated With Current Study\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudy\nPre-Operative Intervention\nPathological Response\nAny Grade AE\nGrade 3-4 AE\n\n\n\n\nOpACIN Blank et al.

This was the case for margin resection of primary melanoma lesions, role for lymphadenectomy, and studies of adjuvant interferon-alfa. Indeed, in the case of adjuvant interferon, even randomized clinical trials were problematic with several demonstrating a relapse-free survival benefit but long-term randomized studies ultimately showed no overall survival benefit. Admittedly, randomized trials are challenging to design for neoadjuvant approaches, but we should expect longer follow-up of patients in such studies and larger, multi-institutional trials should be considered a priority.\nAn important question remains: for which patients should a neoadjuvant approach be adopted? Until there is data that provides evidence that upfront systemic treatment for disease that is potentially curable by surgery alone improves disease-specific survival as compared to administration of the very same intervention at the time of first recurrence, an argument can be made that intensifying treatment for all patients with resectable disease unnecessarily exposes many patients to potentially serious toxicity. To emphasize this point, 60% of the patients in neoadjuvant nivo/rela study had Stage IIIB, which was associated with a 10-year melanoma-specific survival of 88% back in 2017 Gershenwald et al. (2017). Thus, the vast majority of these patients would likely have been cured without upfront systemic therapy. This reality highlights the need to identify biomarkers to further risk-stratify those patients who might benefit from early treatment intensification, such as neoadjuvant immune therapy."

PMID: 36094839\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nOn October 7th, 2022, the multi-institutional Cutaneous Oncology Interest Group Journal Club reviewed the recently published New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) article “Neoadjuvant Cemiplimab for Stage II to IV Cutaneous Squamous-Cell Carcinoma” (Gross et al. 2022). Participants included clinicians and investigators from Massachusetts General Hospital, Mass Eye and Ear Infirmary, Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH), George Washington Cancer Center, the National Institute of Health, University of Pennsylvania and Moffitt Cancer Center. Importantly, the comments in this article represent the views of the authors of this Perspectives on the Science piece after the Journal Club review. It does not represent views of any other members of the Interest Group or the affiliated institutions. Here, we provide a summary of the discussion regarding this important contribution to the literature. Of note, several participants of the Journal Club were investigators of this study and authors on the NEJM article.\n\n\nBackground for the Study\nAlthough the vast majority of cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (CSCC) are treated and cured with local destruction or surgical excision, a subset of patients have poor outcomes, including regional, nodal and distant metastases. Approximately 6% of patients with CSCC will go on to develop nodal or distant disease, resulting in a mortality of 1.5-2% (Patel et al. 2021; Thompson et al. 2016). Consequently, there is an unmet need to find alternative treatment strategies to improve outcomes in patients with high-risk CSCC.\nThe therapeutic landscape for CSCC has rapidly evolved over the last five years (Shalhout et al. 2021, 2023; D. M. Miller et al. 2022) (Figure 1). Recently, clinical trial data has lead to the approval of immune checkpoint inhibitors for locally advanced and metastatic CSCC (Migden et al. 2018; Grob et al. 2020).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Evolving treatment landscape in CSCC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObjective response rates for advanced disease ranging from 46-51% and 35-50% in EMPOWER-CSCC-1 and KEYNOTE-629, respectively, led to the hypotheses tested by Gross et al. that pre-operative anti-PD-1 would improve pathological response rates at the time of surgical excision.\n\n\nStudy Design\nThe investigators conducted a company-sponsored, phase 2, multi-center, non-randomized study involving 79 patients with high-risk disease. Patients were eligible if they had resectable Stage II or greater disease. Of note, only Stage II patients with primary lesions >3 cm were eligible. Subjects received up to four doses of cemiplimab 350 mg every three weeks, followed by surgical resection. The primary endpoint of the study was a pathological complete response (pCR) rate. The null hypotheses was a pCR rate of 25%. Following surgery, investigators were allowed to decide on a post-operative course that included observation, adjuvant radiotherapy or continued cemiplimab.\n\n\nMain Findings\nPathological complete responses were seen in 40 patients (51%), with another 10 patients exhibiting a major pathological response (defined as <10% viable tumor cells seen on the specimen). Adverse events (AEs) were seen in 87% of patients, with grade three or greater AEs occurring in 18% of patients. Four patients died during the study.\n\n\nDiscussion Points\nThe consensus amongst the Interest Group was that this study is indeed practice-changing. A few participants were already incorporating pre-operative immunecheckpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy for some of their highest-risk patients prior the publication of these results. Other participants that were primarily using ICI therapy per the FDA indications (e.g. locally advanced or metastatic disease) stated that they would consider implementing ICI earlier in the disease journey as a result of this study. Participants, however, stressed the importance of assessing the benefit-to-risk ratio. The absolute risk of poor outcomes for various stages of disease studied in this population varies and, in many cases, remain incompletely clarified. This may be due to CSCC not being part of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program. Therefore prognostic estimates of local recurrence, nodal and distant metastases, as well as disease-specific death, have come largely from single-institution datasets and are limited. For example, a 2019 study by Ruiz et al. evaluated the prognosis of 459 patients at BWH (Ruiz et al. 2019). The 10-year cumulative incidence (CIN) rate of local recurrence (LR), nodal metastases (NM) and disease-specific death (DSD) for AJCC Stage II disease was 15.8, 12.2 and 7.6%, respectively in the 36 tumors evaluated. For the 119 T3 tumors (e.g. AJCC Stage III), the 10-year CIN rates for LR, NM and DSD were 19.7, 14.1 and 9.3%, respectively.\nThus the benefits of pre-operative ICI must be weighed in the setting of toxicity. The current study had 4 fatalities, an unusually high proportion, given 79 total subjects. Typical estimated rates of ICI-related mortality are 1:200. Although only one subject’s death was considered possibly related to treatment, all four died of cardiac-related events. These subjects were advanced in age (73, 82, 85 and 93 years old) and had underlying heart disease; thus, making attributions of treatment relatedness challenging. However, we must continue to be vigilant of possible treatment-related effects of ICI therapy given the advanced age of the CSCC population and emerging data that anti-PD-1 therapies may be associated with increases in cardiovascular events and atherosclerotic plaque disruption (Drobni et al. 2020).\nIn the wake of this impactful study, several questions remain. These include the optimal number of doses of pre-operative ICI. Comparable path CR rates were observed in a pilot study two pre-operative doses of cemiplimab in Stage II-IV CSCC (Ferrarotto et al. 2021). Twenty-two percent of the subjects in the study did not received all four doses and 11% did not undergo surgery in the protocol-specified window. Thus, identifying the optimal number of pre-operative doses of ICI therapy remains critical. In addition, understanding the clinical benefit of pre-operative ICI in some of the most at-risk patients is necessary, including those with incompetent immune systems. Furthermore, integrating pre-operative ICIs into a treatment landscape of post-operative systemic therapy, adjuvant radiation therapy or salvage treatment upon disease recurrence remains important unmet need.\n\nThis site represents our opinions only.

Rohaan et al. NEJM. 2022 Dec 8;387(23):2113-2125.\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nOn January 9th, 2023, the multi-institutional Cutaneous Oncology Interest Group Journal Club reviewed the recently published NEJM article “Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocyte Therapy or Ipilimumab in Advanced Melanoma”(Rohaan et al. 2022). Participants included clinicians and investigators from Massachusetts General Hospital, Mass Eye and Ear, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, the National Institutes of Health, George Washington Medical Center, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and the Northwestern Feinberg School of Medicine. Importantly, the comments in this article represent the views of the authors of this Perspectives on the Science piece after the Journal Club. It does not represent views of any other members of the Interest Group or the affiliated institutions. In this article we provide a summary of the discussion regarding this important contribution to the literature.\n\n\nBackground for the Study\nTreatment options for melanoma have advanced greatly in the last several years and continue to evolve (Figure 1). Landmark studies such as KEYNOTE-001/006 and CheckMate-066 have led to single-agent immunotherapy with anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors becoming a first-line treatment options for advanced, unresectable melanoma (Figure 2).(Hamid et al. 2019; Robert et al. 2015; Robert, Ribas, et al. 2019; Schachter et al. 2017; Petrella et al. 2017) Subsequent studies such as CheckMate-067 and RELATIVITY-047 have positioned dual immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) with aPD-1/aCTLA-4 and aPD-1/aLAG-3 monoclonal antibodies as additional options in the front-line setting for appropriate patients. (Wolchok et al. 2017; Tawbi et al. 2022; Long et al. 2022) In addition combined BRAF and MEK inhibition may be efficacious for melanomas with BRAF mutations(Robert, Grob, et al. 2019; Dummer et al. 2018)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Evolving treatment landscape in melanoma.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Front-line therapy in advanced melanoma.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite these treatment measures, primary and acquired resistance is common for all front-line therapeutic options. Unfortunately, outcomes with ICI and targeted therapies in the second-line setting have been disappointing (Figure 3). (Atkins et al. 2023; Silva et al. 2021) Subsequently, the 5 year mortality rate in patients with stage IV disease is 50%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Efficacy of second-line therapy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdoptive cell therapy with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) has shown clinical utility in melanoma since the 1990s (S. A. Rosenberg et al. 1994). In this process, tumor-resident T cells from a patient’s tumor are extracted and expanded ex-vivo. The patient is administered preparative lymphodepleting chemotherapy, often with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, before the T-cells are infused back into the patient with interleukin-2 to further enhance in vivo expansion of cells and boost the antitumor response. While results have varied, multiple phase I and II trials have shown response rates around 50%.(Berg et al. 2020; M. E. Dudley et al. 2008; Steven A. Rosenberg et al. 2011; Besser et al. 2010; Ellebaek et al. 2012; Andersen et al. 2016; M. Dudley et al. 2022; Pilon-Thomas et al. 2012) Several of these studies are summarized in Figure 4. C-144-01, a recently reported study of LN-144 TIL therapy in patients who failed anti-PD-1 immunotherapy reported an objective response rate of 31.4% in a pooled analysis of consecutive cohorts, highlighting potential utility of TIL therapy for patients who have had disease progression on first-line options (Sarnaik et al. 2021).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4. Summary of previous TIL studies in advanced melanoma.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudy Design\nThis was a phase III, multicenter, open-label trial including patients age 18-75 with unresectable stage IIIC or IV melanoma. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive TIL or anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 therapy (ipilimumab) (Figure 5). Patients assigned to the TIL group underwent a metastasectomy for retrieval and expansion of TILs, then received nonmyeloablative, lymphodepleting chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine. Single intravenous adoptive transfer of TILs was followed by high-dose interleukin-2 every 8 hours, for a maximum of 15 doses. Patients in the ipilimumab group received 3 mg per kilogram of body weight every 3 weeks, for up to 4 doses. The primary end point was progression-free survival, defined as the time from randomization to first disease progression or death. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), objective response, complete response, overall survival, health-related quality of life, and safety.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5. Study design.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMain Findings\n168 patients (86% with disease refractory to anti–programmed death 1 treatment) were assigned to receive TILs (84 patients) or ipilimumab (84 patients). Median PFS in the TIL group was 7.2 months, significantly longer than 3.1 months in the ipilimumab group. Objective response rates were 49% in TIL group and 21% (95% CI, 13 to 32) of patients in ipilimumab group. 20% of patients in the TIL group achieved complete response, compared to 7% in the ipilimumab group. At the time of the data cutoff, the overall median follow-up was 33.0 months. Median overall survival was 25.8 months in the TIL group and 18.9 months in the ipilimumab group. In regards to safety, treatment related adverse events occurred in all patients in the TIL group and in 96% of those in the ipilimumab group. All patients in the TIL group experienced grade 3 adverse events, due to chemotherapy-related myelosuppression, while 57% of patients in the ipilimumab group experienced grade 3 or higher adverse events. Overall, patients in the TIL group had higher mean health-related quality of life scores than those in the ipilimumab group, though scores varied for different symptoms.\n\n\nDiscussion Points\nImproving outcomes for patients with ICI-refractory disease is a critical need. The treatment landscape is evolving and clinicians currently only have a few options to choose from when patients progress on first-line monotherapy anti-PD-1. Commercially-available options include monotherapy ipilimumab, dual ICB with ipilimumab/nivolumab or ipilimumab/relatlimab and combination targeted therapies for patients with actionable BRAF V600 mutations. When provided with a clinical vignette of ICI-refractory wild-type melanoma, the vast majority of the diverse group of COIG attendees at the January 9th journal club that treat melanoma (Figure 6) responded that they would have selected combination ipilimumab/nivolumab (Figure 7). Given the patient’s ECOG status of 2, one respondent replied that they have recommended combination CTLA-4/LAG-3 in this case. None of the practioners would have recommended monotherapy ipilimumab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6. Journal club attendees\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7. Management strategies of ICI-refractory melanoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttendees recognized that while dual ICB and combination oncogene-targeted therapies can produce responses in the second-line and beyond, meaningful clinical benefit is limited to a fraction of patients. For many years, TIL therapy has produced intriguing results in small, non-comparative investigations. Given the lack of commercial approval, TIL therapy has not been widely adopted. However, the majority of melanoma clinicians at the January 9th COIG JC have recommended TIL therapy previously as part of their practice (Figure 8).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8. Experience with TIL therapy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurthermore, most were affiliates at institutions with a cell therapy group capable of delivery TIL therapy (Figure 9).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9. Cell therapy capabilities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThus, the results from Rohaan et al were of a considerable interest. TIL therapy was associated with a clinically meaningful 50% reduction in the hazard for progression or death compared with monotherapy ipilimumab. Despite the majority of patients being treated previously with immunotherapy, nearly one-half of the patients experienced a response to TIL therapy. Importantly, responses were durable in the majority of patients that experienced an initial response. These data corroborate the findings in C-144-01, in which 15-20% of the heavily pre-treated cohort experienced durable responses following administration of lifileucel (Sarnaik et al. 2021). Taking collectively, TIL therapy is likely to become a standard option in the field. Indeed, Iovance, the sponsor of C-144-01, is expecting the rolling Biologics Licences Application (BLA) submission of lifileucel to be completed in the first half of 2023. Interestingly, while the attendees verbalized that the study by Rohaan et al. was a landmark investigation, less than half replied that it would change their practice (Figure 10).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10. Practice changing nature of the study\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndeed, when presented with the same case of refractory advanced melanoma, but given the option of having TIL therapy available, only 1/9 clinicians responded that they would recommend TIL therapy (Figure 11).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11. Case one revisted\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly a minority of respondents replied that if approved, TIL therapy would become their preferred treatment strategy for PD-1 refractory melanoma (Figure 12)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12. Implementation of TIL therapy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite the promise of TIL therapy, there are several challenges with its adoption and implementation. Most notably are the risks associate with its use. Grade 3 or higher treatment related adverse event (TRAEs) were nearly universal in both C-144-01 and the study by Rohaan et al. Granted the vast majority were expected from the lymphodepleting agents used as part of the conditioning regimen and were transient and manageable. Nevertheless, 86% experienced the potentially life-threatening complication febrile neutropenia and 10% of patients required transfer to the intensive care unit. When compared to the other treatment options for refractory disease, TIL therapy appears to offer a trade off of enhanced efficacy at the expense of increased toxicity (Figure 13).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13. Risk benefit of therapeutic strategies for PD-1 refractory disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother consideration and potential barrier to TIL therapy are the logistics required for preparation. Adequate and accessible tumor tissue is needed, as is several weeks for cultivation and expansion of donor cells. Therefore, TILs may be less appropirate for patients with hard-to-access metastases and/or rapidly progressing disease. Thus, the use of TIL therapy is likely to be individualized and utilized in centers with experienced practioners. Nevertheless, the studies by Sarnaik et al. and Rohaan et al. represent important contributions to the field and will likely lead to clinicians having additional options for their patients in the near future.\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\nThis Perspectives on the Science piece was published using Quarto®.

Kim et al. Lancet 2022 Sep 24;400(10357):1008-1019. PMID: 36108657\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nOn November 7th, 2022, the multi-institutional Cutaneous Oncology Interest Group Journal Club reviewed the recently published Lancet article “Combined Nivolumab and Ipilimumab with or without Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy for Advanced Merkel cell carcinoma: A Randomised, Open Label, Phase 2 Trial” (Kim et al. 2022). Participants included clinicians and investigators from Massachusetts General Hospital, Mass Eye and Ear Infirmary, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, University of Washington School of Medicine, the National Institute of Health, Northwestern University, University of Pennsylvania and Moffitt Cancer Center. Importantly, the comments in this article represent the views of the authors of this Perspectives on the Science piece after the Journal Club. It does not represent views of any other members of the Interest Group or the affiliated institutions. In this article we provide a summary of the discussion regarding this important contribution to the literature. Of note, one participant of the Journal Club is an investigator of the discussed study and an author on the Lancet article.\n\n\nBackground for the Study\nMerkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare cutaneous neuroendocrine carcinoma often associated with chronic ultraviolet light exposure, a suppressed or weakened immune system, and/or the Merkel Cell Polyoma Virus (MCPyV). This aggressive skin cancer has a high distant metastasis rate, associated with a poor prognosis.\nThe advent of immunotherapeutics and the regulatory approvals of anti-PD-L1 and anti-PD-1 agents for MCC have revolutionized the treatment landscape. Avelumab received an accelerated FDA approval for metastatic MCC in 2017. Pembrolizumab was approved by the FDA in 2018 for the treatment of recurrent, locally advanced, and metastatic MCC. Immunotherapy is associated with durable responses in MCC and pivotal trials reported an objective response rate (ORR) of 39.7% (95% CI 30.7-49.2) for avelumab in the first line setting and an ORR of 33% (95% CI 23.3–43.8) in the chemotherapy-refractory setting (Kaufman et al. 2016; D’Angelo et al. 2021, 2020). An ORR of 58% (95% CI 43.2–71.8) was observed with pembrolizumab in the first line setting (Nghiem et al. 2016). While anti-PD-L1 and anti-PD-1 monotherapy have been established as the standard of care for the treatment of advanced MCC, there are few systemic therapy options for those patients who have primary or acquired resistance and fail anti-PD(L)-1 treatment. Therefore, evaluating combination ipilimumab with nivolumab in patients who progress on anti-PD(L)-1 monotherapy as well as immunotherapy-naïve patients with MCC is warranted. Finally, since MCC is exceptionally radiosensitive and subablative hypofractionated radiotherapy may prime for anti-tumor immune responses, assessing combination ipilimumab with nivolumab in immunotherapy-naïve and refractory patients with or without the addition of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is worthy of investigation (Demaria, Golden, and Formenti 2015).\n\n\nStudy Design\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Schema\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis study received funding from the company and patients were enrolled from the Moffitt Cancer Center and Ohio State University James Cancer Hospital & Solove Research Institute. The investigators conducted an open-label, Phase II study with eligible patients randomized (1:1) to Group A or B, two experimental groups. Group A was designed to evaluate the clinical efficacy of combination ipilimumab plus nivolumab (Ipi/Nivo) in patients with unresectable, recurrent, or stage IV MCC and Group B was designed to determine the clinical efficacy of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) with combination Ipi/Nivo. Patients were stratified as ICI-naïve or following previous ICI failure (See Figure 1).\nSubjects were administered 240 mg intravenous (IV) nivolumab every 2 weeks and IV ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks. Patients randomized to Group B also received SBRT to a minimum of one tumor/lesion site at a dose of 24 Gy (3 fractions). The primary endpoint was the ORR in all eligible randomized patients per immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (irRECIST). See the tables below for key inclusion and exclusion criteria and secondary and exploratory endpoints.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Key inclusion and exclusion criteria\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Study endpoints\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMain Findings\nResponses were observed in 18/25 (72%) of the subjects enrolled in Group A and 12/23 (52%) of the Group B patients. No statistically significant difference was reported between the two experimental groups (p value = 0.26). Analysis of the pooled ‘ICI-naïve’ versus ‘previous-ICI’ cohorts showed that 100% (95% CI 82-100; 22/22 subjects) of the ICI-naïve patients experienced an objective response while only 31% (95% CI 15-52; 8/26 subjects) of the previous-ICI patients had an objective response. Reported adverse events (AEs) were attributed to combination Ipi/Nivo with minimal SBRT-AEs observed. Any-Grade AEs occurred in 90% (40/50) of the subjects and Grade III/IV AEs were reported in 40% (10/25) of Group A patients and 32% ( 8/25) of Group B patients.\n\n\nDiscussion Points\nWe began Journal Club on November 7th, 2022 by administering a poll among the attendees via poll everywhere. Our goal was to conduct a brief survey before and after journal club discussions to determine the current practices of clinicians participating in the dialogue and whether review/discussion of the article would be ‘practice-changing.’ The following reflects the survey results of the poll administered at the start of the meeting:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4. Journal club attendees\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5. Management approach to stage IIIB MCC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6. Management approach to Stage IV MCC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7. First line ipi/nivo in real-world practice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following reflects the survey results of the poll after our discussion and article review:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8. Management approach to Stage IV MCC revisited.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9. Practice changing nature of the curent study.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSurvey results demonstrate that upon review and discussion of the article, the study is indeed “practice-changing” among the Cutaneous Oncology Interest Group Journal Club attendees. According to the poll, the vast majority of participants were not administering Ipi/Nivo for advanced MCC a year ago, and have never administered Ipi/Nivo as a first-line therapy for MCC. The post-discussion survey shows the majority of participants will change their treatment recommendations for MCC after review of the article, and are more likely now to recommend Ipi/Nivo in light of the data/results of the phase II trial. With an ORR of 100% in the ICI-naive cohort, potentially administering Ipi/Nivo in the first-line may be a reasonable management option moving forward. However, we must continue to weigh potential risks in the setting of increased toxicity with combination ICI versus monotherapy anti-PD(L)-1. Below, a table of the Grade III+ reported AEs from the avelumab, and pembrolizumab pivotal trials are listed alongside the grade III/IV AEs described in this study. Of note, the dosing regimen utilized in both Group A and B differs from that recommended for melanoma. Ipi was administered every 6 weeks at 1mg/kg with nivo every 2 weeks at 240mg and demonstrated clinical efficacy in MCC. This may likely be associated with reduced toxicity comparable to other dosing regimens, but appears higher than anti-PD(L)-1 mono therapy. However, direct comparisons across the trials with different numbers of enrolled patients and duration of therapies is cautioned (see Table below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10. Adverse reactions of ICI in MCC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA favored suggestion amongst the group for future directions included a multi-center, randomized clinical trial evaluating monotherapy anti-PD(L)-1 versus Ipi/Nivo (first-line) for advanced MCC, to assess efficacy and toxicity differences across the different regimens. That said, participants acknowledged that large comparative trials remain difficult to conduct in rare diseases such as MCC. Indeed, the two therapies approved in MCC (avelumab and pembrolizumab) came via single arm, non-comparative studies, with overall limited sample sizes (n = 88 and n = 50, respectively). In this context, the question of whether the present study should be sufficient for additional labeling information for ipilimumab and nivolumab was raised. When viewed in the backdrop of the evolving regulatory landscape on cutaneous oncology, the current study shares many of the features of recent studies that have led to label modifications in skin cancer (Miller et al. 2022). For example, an analysis of the evidence used to support labeled claims in skin cancer from 1949 to February 09, 2021 demonstrated that the most common endpoint incorporate some form of tumor response, such as ORR, used by Kim et al. Interestingly, the present study demonstrated a response rate that surpassed any previously reported BLA or NDA-enabling study. Of the 30 labeling modifications supported by results of studies incorporating tumor response, the observed ORR ranged from 15.9-83.3%, with a median of 34% (Miller et al. 2022). In the first-line setting, Ipi/Nivo resulted in responses in an awe-inspiring 100% of patients. Furthermore, although limited in sample size, 50 enrolled subjects is also comparable to many studies supporting efficacy labelling modifications in skin cancer. There have been 62 studies with less than 100 subjects and 8 studies with 50 or fewer (range = 12-1127) (Miller et al. 2022). In our opinion, the data presented by Kim et al. unequivocally establishes activity of ipilimumab/nivolumab in MCC. Moreover, the risk profile is appropriate for the disease context and observed efficacy. Given the importance of product labels in both informing clinicians and insurance coverage, the authors support a consideration of this data by the agency for a supplemental accelerated approval label of ipilimumab/nivolumab for advanced MCC in the first-line setting.\nIn the second-line setting, the study also provides rationale that Ipi/Nivo administered earlier in the course of the disease may offer more benefit. For example, a recent retrospective study (N=13) assessing real-world outcomes of Ipi/Nivo in ICI-refractory patients had an ORR of 0% but the majority of patients had an ECOG PS > 1 with advanced stage disease (Shalhout et al. 2022). In the wake of an ORR of 31% in the phase II trial among the previous-ICI cohort, perhaps Ipi/Nivo up-front may become the standard of care for advanced MCC. Additional real-world studies, although limited by confounding and bias, may provide important supportive evidence of this claim. Currently, Ipi/Nivo in the second line may offer some to little benefit but this highlights the need for more therapeutic options for the refractory setting.\n\nThis site represents our opinions only.

    "text": "Background for the Study\n\n\n\nThe therapeutic landscape in melanoma has evolved significantly since the first approval in 1967, with 48 US FDA actions for therapies indicated for the adjuvant, locally advanced and metastatic setting (D. M. Miller et al. (2022)) (Figure 1) .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1 - FDA Approvals in Melanoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the number of therapeutic options have increased, patients with macroscopic nodal metastases have a risk of melanoma-specific mortality that can approximate 75% (Gershenwald et al. (2017)). Recent strategies to improve outcomes in this high-risk subset of patients includes peri-operative administration of therapies previously shown to have efficacy in the locally advanced and unresectable setting. Post-operative monotherapy anti-PD1 has been shown to decrease the risk of recurrence by as much as 50% (Weber et al. (2017); Eggermont et al. (2018)). These studies led to the FDA-approval of nivolumab for resected Stage III disease in 2017 and pembrolizumab in 2019 (Figure 2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2 - FDA Approved Agents for Resected Melanoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPre-operative administration of systemic therapy has the potential to improve clinical outcomes by expanding antigen-specific immune response in the setting of an in situ tumor and preserved lymphatics (Liu et al. (2016)). Indeed, recently presented data at the 2022 Congress of the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) demonstrated the superiority of combining pre-operative with post-operative anti-PD1 compared to adjuvant-only anti-PD1 (Patel et al. (2022)). In the phase 2 study SWOG S1801, 313 patients with Stage IIIB-IV melanoma were randomized to either 3 doses of pre-operative pembrolizumab followed by 15 doses of adjuvant pembrolizumab or upfront surgery followed by 18 doses of post-operative pembrolizumab. Neoadjuvant plus adjuvant pembrolizumab was associated with a significantly higher event-free survival (EFS) (HR 0.59, 95% CI, 0.40-0.86) versus adjuvant-only therapy. In addition to potentially improving outcomes compared to post-operative-only therapy, by intensifying upfront treatment with neoadjuvant therapy, clinicians can utilize pathological information gained at the time of surgery to tailor post-operative management. The optimal neoadjuvant strategy, however, has not been identified; though several approaches have been evaluated. In a phase 2 study of 23 patients, ipilimumab plus nivolumab was compared to monotherapy nivolumab in the neoadjuvant setting (Amaria et al. (2018)) (Figure 3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3 - Neoadjuvant Ipi/Nivo vs. Nivolumab Study Design\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough limited in size, the study’s results suggested that three doses of ipilimumab 3 mg/kg plus nivolumab 1 mg/kg was associated with significant clinical activity, producing a complete pathological response (pCR) in 45% of patients. Despite not being adequately powered for comparison, the response seen with dual immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) appeared higher than with 4 doses of monotherapy anti-PD1 (pCR 25%). Combination Ipi/Nivo, however, resulted in grade 3-4 treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in 73% of patients.\nIn the OpACIN study, the combination of ipilimumab 3 mg/kg and nivolumab 1 mg/kg administered over two doses prior to surgery produced a pathological response in 7/9 (78%) patients, with 3/9 (33%) demonstrating a complete response (Blank et al. (2018))(Figure 4). Similar to the previous study, TEAEs were seen in 100% of patients, with 90% of patients experiencing grade 3-4 toxicity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4 - OpACIN Study Design\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an effort to identify the optimal combination dosing schedule of dual ICB, investigators of the OpACIN-neo study randomly assigned 105 patients to one of three combination regimens: Group A patients received two cycles of every three week (q3 week) ipilimumab 3 mg/kg plus nivolumab 1 mg/kg (Ipi 3/Nivo 1); Group B patients received two cycles of q3 week ipilimumab 1 mg/kg plus nivolumab 3 mg/kg (Ipi 1/Nivo 3) ; and Group C patients received two cycles of q3 week ipilimumab 3 mg/kg followed by two cycles of q2 week nivolumab 3 mg/kg (Ipi 3 followed by Nivo 3) (Rozeman et al. (2019)) (Figure 5). Recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates were similar between the 86 patients who were enrolled in the three groups, while grade 3-4 AEs were lower in the Ipi 1/Nivo 3 cohort (20%) compared to Ipi 3/Nivo 1 (40%) and the Ipi 3 followed by Nivo 3 (50%).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5 - OpACIN-neo Study Design\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven the favorable risk/benefit findings of Ipi 1/Nivo 3, an expansion cohort of OpACIN-neo was enrolled to investigate the role of assessing pathologic response in the index lymph node (ILN) in determining post-operative management (Figure 6). This study, named the PRADO Trial (Personalized response-directed surgery and adjuvant therapy after neoadjuvant ipilimumab and nivolumab in high-risk stage III melanoma), found that two pre-operative doses of Ipi 1/Nivo 3 yielded a 72% pathological response (PR) rate (49% pCR, 12% near-pCR, 11% partial PR).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6 - PRADO Study Design\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantly, patients that achieved a major pathological response (MPR, ≤10% viable tumor cells) and no further treatment had a recurrence-free survival (RFS) of 93% at 2 years compared to 64% for subjects that were pathological non-responders that went on to have a total lymph node dissection (TLND) and adjuvant systemic therapy. These results support the importance and role of pathological response assessment following upfront immunotherapy in post-operative management decisions, including the potential for de-escalation of therapy for patients with excellent pathological responses.\nAlthough there are no therapies with labelled indications in the neoadjuvant setting, these studies support the clinical utility of pre-operative immune checkpoint blockade (Table 1). Given the favorable responses seen with neoadjuvant treatment, the aforementioned clinical trials highlight the goal of continued investigation to find new approaches that augment immunological anti-tumor responses and minimize off-target autoimmunity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1 - Summary of Neoadjuvant Studies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudy\nPre-Operative Intervention\nPathological Response\nAny Grade AE\nGrade 3-4 AE\n\n\n\n\nOpACIN Blank et al.

Approval was based on data from the phase 2-3 study RELATIVITY-047, in which combination Nivo/Rela was associated with improved progression-free survial (PFS) compared to single-agent nivolumab (10.12 vs. 4.63 months, HR 0.75 (95% CI, 0.62 - 0.92)) (Tawbi et al.

Any grade toxicity was seen in 97.2% of patients treated with combination therapy vs. 94.4% single-agent nivolumab. Grade 3-4 AEs were seen in 40.3% of patients who received Nivo/Rela vs. 33.4% of those administered nivolumab monotherapy. Based on the improved PFS and acceptable safety profile seen in RELATIVITY-047, the OpACIN-neo investigators opened a new arm of NCT02519322 to evaluate the pCR rate, safety and efficacy of peri-operative Nivo/Rela."

PMID: 36094839\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nOn October 7th, 2022, the multi-institutional Cutaneous Oncology Interest Group Journal Club reviewed the recently published New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) article “Neoadjuvant Cemiplimab for Stage II to IV Cutaneous Squamous-Cell Carcinoma” (Gross et al. 2022). Participants included clinicians and investigators from Massachusetts General Hospital, Mass Eye and Ear Infirmary, Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH), George Washington Cancer Center, the National Institute of Health, University of Pennsylvania and Moffitt Cancer Center. Importantly, the comments in this article represent the views of the authors of this Perspectives on the Science piece after the Journal Club review. It does not represent views of any other members of the Interest Group or the affiliated institutions. Here, we provide a summary of the discussion regarding this important contribution to the literature. Of note, several participants of the Journal Club were investigators of this study and authors on the NEJM article.\n\n\nBackground for the Study\nAlthough the vast majority of cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (CSCC) are treated and cured with local destruction or surgical excision, a subset of patients have poor outcomes, including regional, nodal and distant metastases. Approximately 6% of patients with CSCC will go on to develop nodal or distant disease, resulting in a mortality of 1.5-2% (Patel et al. 2021; Thompson et al. 2016). Consequently, there is an unmet need to find alternative treatment strategies to improve outcomes in patients with high-risk CSCC.\nThe therapeutic landscape for CSCC has rapidly evolved over the last five years (Shalhout et al. 2021, 2023; D. M. Miller et al. 2022) (Figure 1). Recently, clinical trial data has lead to the approval of immune checkpoint inhibitors for locally advanced and metastatic CSCC (Migden et al. 2018; Grob et al. 2020).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Evolving treatment landscape in CSCC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObjective response rates for advanced disease ranging from 46-51% and 35-50% in EMPOWER-CSCC-1 and KEYNOTE-629, respectively, led to the hypotheses tested by Gross et al. that pre-operative anti-PD-1 would improve pathological response rates at the time of surgical excision.\n\n\nStudy Design\nThe investigators conducted a company-sponsored, phase 2, multi-center, non-randomized study involving 79 patients with high-risk disease. Patients were eligible if they had resectable Stage II or greater disease. Of note, only Stage II patients with primary lesions >3 cm were eligible. Subjects received up to four doses of cemiplimab 350 mg every three weeks, followed by surgical resection. The primary endpoint of the study was a pathological complete response (pCR) rate. The null hypotheses was a pCR rate of 25%. Following surgery, investigators were allowed to decide on a post-operative course that included observation, adjuvant radiotherapy or continued cemiplimab.\n\n\nMain Findings\nPathological complete responses were seen in 40 patients (51%), with another 10 patients exhibiting a major pathological response (defined as <10% viable tumor cells seen on the specimen). Adverse events (AEs) were seen in 87% of patients, with grade three or greater AEs occurring in 18% of patients. Four patients died during the study.\n\n\nDiscussion Points\nThe consensus amongst the Interest Group was that this study is indeed practice-changing. A few participants were already incorporating pre-operative immunecheckpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy for some of their highest-risk patients prior the publication of these results. Other participants that were primarily using ICI therapy per the FDA indications (e.g. locally advanced or metastatic disease) stated that they would consider implementing ICI earlier in the disease journey as a result of this study. Participants, however, stressed the importance of assessing the benefit-to-risk ratio. The absolute risk of poor outcomes for various stages of disease studied in this population varies and, in many cases, remain incompletely clarified. This may be due to CSCC not being part of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program. Therefore prognostic estimates of local recurrence, nodal and distant metastases, as well as disease-specific death, have come largely from single-institution datasets and are limited. For example, a 2019 study by Ruiz et al. evaluated the prognosis of 459 patients at BWH (Ruiz et al. 2019). The 10-year cumulative incidence (CIN) rate of local recurrence (LR), nodal metastases (NM) and disease-specific death (DSD) for AJCC Stage II disease was 15.8, 12.2 and 7.6%, respectively in the 36 tumors evaluated. For the 119 T3 tumors (e.g. AJCC Stage III), the 10-year CIN rates for LR, NM and DSD were 19.7, 14.1 and 9.3%, respectively.\nThus the benefits of pre-operative ICI must be weighed in the setting of toxicity. The current study had 4 fatalities, an unusually high proportion, given 79 total subjects. Typical estimated rates of ICI-related mortality are 1:200. Although only one subject’s death was considered possibly related to treatment, all four died of cardiac-related events. These subjects were advanced in age (73, 82, 85 and 93 years old) and had underlying heart disease; thus, making attributions of treatment relatedness challenging. However, we must continue to be vigilant of possible treatment-related effects of ICI therapy given the advanced age of the CSCC population and emerging data that anti-PD-1 therapies may be associated with increases in cardiovascular events and atherosclerotic plaque disruption (Drobni et al. 2020).\nIn the wake of this impactful study, several questions remain. These include the optimal number of doses of pre-operative ICI. Comparable path CR rates were observed in a pilot study two pre-operative doses of cemiplimab in Stage II-IV CSCC (Ferrarotto et al. 2021). Twenty-two percent of the subjects in the study did not received all four doses and 11% did not undergo surgery in the protocol-specified window. Thus, identifying the optimal number of pre-operative doses of ICI therapy remains critical. In addition, understanding the clinical benefit of pre-operative ICI in some of the most at-risk patients is necessary, including those with incompetent immune systems. Furthermore, integrating pre-operative ICIs into a treatment landscape of post-operative systemic therapy, adjuvant radiation therapy or salvage treatment upon disease recurrence remains important unmet need.\n\nThis site represents our opinions only.

Rohaan et al. NEJM. 2022 Dec 8;387(23):2113-2125.\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nOn January 9th, 2023, the multi-institutional Cutaneous Oncology Interest Group Journal Club reviewed the recently published NEJM article “Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocyte Therapy or Ipilimumab in Advanced Melanoma”(Rohaan et al. 2022). Participants included clinicians and investigators from Massachusetts General Hospital, Mass Eye and Ear, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, the National Institutes of Health, George Washington Medical Center, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and the Northwestern Feinberg School of Medicine. Importantly, the comments in this article represent the views of the authors of this Perspectives on the Science piece after the Journal Club. It does not represent views of any other members of the Interest Group or the affiliated institutions. In this article we provide a summary of the discussion regarding this important contribution to the literature.\n\n\nBackground for the Study\nTreatment options for melanoma have advanced greatly in the last several years and continue to evolve (Figure 1). Landmark studies such as KEYNOTE-001/006 and CheckMate-066 have led to single-agent immunotherapy with anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors becoming a first-line treatment options for advanced, unresectable melanoma (Figure 2)(Hamid et al. 2019; Robert et al. 2015; Robert, Ribas, et al. 2019; Schachter et al. 2017; Petrella et al. 2017). Subsequent studies such as CheckMate-067 and RELATIVITY-047 have positioned dual immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) with aPD-1/aCTLA-4 and aPD-1/aLAG-3 monoclonal antibodies as additional options in the front-line setting for appropriate patients (Wolchok et al. 2017; Tawbi et al. 2022; Long et al. 2022). In addition combined BRAF and MEK inhibition is an option for melanomas with BRAF mutations (Robert, Grob, et al. 2019; Dummer et al. 2018).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Evolving treatment landscape in melanoma.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Front-line therapy in advanced melanoma.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite these treatment measures, primary and acquired resistance is common for all front-line therapeutic options. Unfortunately, outcomes with ICI and targeted therapies in the second-line setting have been disappointing (Figure 3). (Atkins et al. 2023; Silva et al. 2021) Subsequently, the 5 year mortality rate in patients with stage IV disease is 50%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Efficacy of second-line therapy in advanced melanoma.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdoptive cell therapy with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) has shown clinical utility in melanoma since the 1990s (S. A. Rosenberg et al. 1994). In this process, tumor-resident T cells from a patient’s tumor are extracted and expanded ex-vivo. The patient is administered preparative lymphodepleting chemotherapy, often with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, before the T-cells are infused back into the patient with interleukin-2 to further enhance in vivo expansion of cells and boost the antitumor response. While results have varied, multiple phase I and II trials have shown response rates around 50% (Berg et al. 2020; M. E. Dudley et al. 2008; Steven A. Rosenberg et al. 2011; Besser et al. 2010; Ellebaek et al. 2012; Andersen et al. 2016; M. Dudley et al. 2022; Pilon-Thomas et al. 2012). Several of these studies are summarized in Table 1. C-144-01, a recently reported study of LN-144 TIL therapy in patients who failed anti-PD-1 immunotherapy reported an objective response rate of 31.4% in a pooled analysis of consecutive cohorts, highlighting potential utility of TIL therapy for patients who have had disease progression on first-line options (Sarnaik et al. 2021).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1. Summary of previous TIL studies in advanced melanoma.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudy\nResults\n\n\n\n\nBesser et al. (2010)\nPhase II study, 20 evaluated patients, 50% objective clinical response (2 CR, 8 PR)\n\n\nSteven A. Rosenberg et al. (2011)\nObjective response rates using lymphodepleting preparative regimens (chemotherapy alone or with 2 or 12 Gy irradiation) were 49%, 52%, and 72%, respectively.  Of 93 treated patients, 52 (56%) had an objective response.  Twenty patients (22%) had CR, 19 with ongoing CR beyond 3 years\n\n\nPilon-Thomas et al. (2012)\n19 patients enrolled, 13 completed treatment  Overall response rate of 26% by intention-to-treat  Overall response rate 38% among the 13 treated, 2 CRs and 3 PRs.\n\n\nEllebaek et al. (2012)\nOf 6 treated patients, 2 patients achieved a complete response (CR),  2 patients had stable disease (SD) and 2 patients progressed rapidly\n\n\nAndersen et al. (2016)\n25 patients, 3 CRs and 7 PRs (ORR 42%)  Median overall survival was 21.8 months\n\n\nBerg et al. (2020)\nFive out of 10 patients (all anti-PD-1 naïve) showed an objective clinical response, including two patients with a complete response that are both ongoing for more than 7 years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudy Design\nThe study by Rohaan et al. was a phase III, multicenter, open-label trial including Dutch patients age 18-75 with unresectable stage IIIC or IV melanoma. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive TIL or anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4) therapy (ipilimumab) (Figure 4). Patients assigned to the TIL group underwent a metastasectomy for retrieval and expansion of TILs, then received nonmyeloablative, lymphodepleting chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine. Single intravenous adoptive transfer of TILs was followed by high-dose interleukin-2 every 8 hours, for a maximum of 15 doses. Patients in the ipilimumab group received 3 mg per kilogram of body weight every 3 weeks, for up to 4 doses. The primary end point was progression-free survival, defined as the time from randomization to first disease progression or death. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), objective response, complete response, overall survival, health-related quality of life, and safety.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4. Study design.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMain Findings\n168 patients (86% with disease refractory to anti–programmed death 1 treatment) were assigned to receive TILs (84 patients) or ipilimumab (84 patients). Median PFS in the TIL group was 7.2 months, significantly longer than 3.1 months in the ipilimumab group. Objective response rates were 49% in TIL group and 21% (95% CI, 13 to 32) of patients in ipilimumab group. 20% of patients in the TIL group achieved complete response, compared to 7% in the ipilimumab group. At the time of the data cutoff, the overall median follow-up was 33.0 months. Median overall survival was 25.8 months in the TIL group and 18.9 months in the ipilimumab group. In regards to safety, treatment related adverse events occurred in all patients in the TIL group and in 96% of those in the ipilimumab group. All patients in the TIL group experienced grade 3 adverse events, largely due to chemotherapy-related myelosuppression, while 57% of patients in the ipilimumab group experienced grade 3 or higher adverse events. Overall, patients in the TIL group had higher mean health-related quality of life scores than those in the ipilimumab group, though scores varied for different symptoms.\n\n\nDiscussion Points\nImproving outcomes for patients with ICI-refractory disease is a critical need. The treatment landscape is evolving and clinicians currently only have a few options to choose from when patients progress on first-line anti-PD-1 monotherapy. Commercially-available options include monotherapy ipilimumab, dual ICB with ipilimumab/nivolumab or ipilimumab/relatlimab and combination targeted therapies for patients with actionable BRAF V600 mutations. When provided with a clinical vignette of ICI-refractory wild-type melanoma, the vast majority of the diverse group of COIG attendees at the January 9th journal club that treat melanoma (Figure 5) responded that they would have selected combination ipilimumab/nivolumab (Figure 6). Given the patient’s ECOG status of 2, one respondent replied that they have recommended combination CTLA-4/LAG-3 in this case. None of the practioners would have recommended monotherapy ipilimumab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5. Journal club attendees\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6. Management strategies of ICI-refractory melanoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttendees recognized that while dual ICB and combination oncogene-targeted therapies can produce responses in the second-line and beyond, meaningful clinical benefit is limited to a fraction of patients. For many years, TIL therapy has produced intriguing results in small, non-comparative investigations. Given the lack of commercial approval, TIL therapy has not been widely adopted. However, the majority of melanoma clinicians at the January 9th COIG JC have recommended TIL therapy previously as part of their practice (Figure 7). Some participants also recognized the importance of this paper as it is one of very few prospective, randomized trials of TIL therapy. While this is, in part, due to the challenges in identifying an appropriate control group, the data reported did identify a significant improvement in cinical outcome and a high ORR of 49% in a refractory melanoma population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7. Experience with TIL therapy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurthermore, most were affiliates at institutions with a cell therapy group capable of delivery TIL therapy (Figure 8).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8. Cell therapy capabilities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThus, the results from Rohaan et al. were of a considerable interest. TIL therapy was associated with a clinically meaningful 50% reduction in the hazard for progression or death compared with monotherapy ipilimumab. Despite the majority of patients being treated previously with immunotherapy, nearly one-half of the patients experienced a response to TIL therapy. Importantly, responses were durable in the majority of patients that experienced an initial response. These data corroborate the findings in C-144-01, in which 15-20% of the heavily pre-treated cohort experienced durable responses following administration of lifileucel (Sarnaik et al. 2021). Taken collectively, TIL therapy is likely to become a standard option in the field. Indeed, Iovance, the sponsor of C-144-01, is expecting the rolling Biologics Licences Application (BLA) submission of lifileucel to be completed in the first half of 2023. Interestingly, while the attendees verbalized that the study by Rohaan et al. was a landmark investigation, less than half replied that it would change their practice (Figure 9).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9. Practice changing nature of the study\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndeed, when presented with the same case of refractory advanced melanoma, but given the option of having TIL therapy available, only 1/9 clinicians responded that they would recommend TIL therapy (Figure 10).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10. Case one revisted\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly a minority of respondents replied that if approved, TIL therapy would become their preferred treatment strategy for PD-1 refractory melanoma (Figure 11). Toxicity and logistics of use were both discussed as considerations when selecting patients that might benefit from TIL therapy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11. Implementation of TIL therapy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite the promise of TIL therapy, there are several challenges with its adoption and implementation. Most notably are the risks associate with its use. Grade 3 or higher treatment related adverse event (TRAEs) were nearly universal in both C-144-01 and the study by Rohaan et al. Granted, the vast majority were expected from the lymphodepleting agents used as part of the conditioning regimen, were transient and manageable. Nevertheless, 86% experienced the potentially life-threatening complication of febrile neutropenia and 10% of patients required transfer to the intensive care unit. When compared to the other treatment options for refractory disease, TIL therapy appears to offer a trade off of enhanced efficacy at the expense of increased toxicity (Figure 12).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12. Risk benefit of therapeutic strategies for PD-1 refractory disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother consideration and potential barrier to TIL therapy are the logistics required for preparation. Adequate and accessible tumor tissue is needed, as is several weeks for cultivation and expansion of donor cells. Therefore, TILs may be less appropirate for patients with hard-to-access metastases and/or rapidly progressing disease. Thus, the use of TIL therapy is likely to be individualized and utilized in centers with experienced practioners. Nevertheless, the studies by Sarnaik et al. and Rohaan et al. reported a higher rate of TIL generation after harvesting suggesting improved technical capabilities to generate TIL are now available. In summary, these reports represent important contributions to the field and will likely lead to clinicians having additional options for their patients in the near future.\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\nThis Perspectives on the Science piece was published using Quarto®.

Kim et al. Lancet 2022 Sep 24;400(10357):1008-1019. PMID: 36108657\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nOn November 7th, 2022, the multi-institutional Cutaneous Oncology Interest Group Journal Club reviewed the recently published Lancet article “Combined Nivolumab and Ipilimumab with or without Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy for Advanced Merkel cell carcinoma: A Randomised, Open Label, Phase 2 Trial”. Kim et al. (2022) Participants included clinicians and investigators from Massachusetts General Hospital, Mass Eye and Ear Infirmary, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, University of Washington School of Medicine, the National Institute of Health, Northwestern University, University of Pennsylvania and Moffitt Cancer Center. Importantly, the comments in this article represent the views of the authors of this Perspectives on the Science piece after the Journal Club. It does not represent views of any other members of the Interest Group or the affiliated institutions. In this article we provide a summary of the discussion regarding this important contribution to the literature. Of note, one participant of the Journal Club is an investigator of the discussed study and an author on the Lancet article.\n\n\nBackground for the Study\nMerkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare cutaneous neuroendocrine carcinoma often associated with chronic ultraviolet light exposure, a suppressed or weakened immune system, and/or the Merkel Cell Polyoma Virus (MCPyV). This aggressive skin cancer has a high distant metastasis rate, associated with a poor prognosis.\nThe advent of immunotherapeutics and the regulatory approvals of anti-PD-L1 and anti-PD-1 agents for MCC have revolutionized the treatment landscape. Avelumab received an accelerated FDA approval for metastatic MCC in 2017. Pembrolizumab was approved by the FDA in 2018 for the treatment of recurrent, locally advanced, and metastatic MCC. Immunotherapy is associated with durable responses in MCC and pivotal trials reported an objective response rate (ORR) of 39.7% (95% CI 30.7-49.2) for avelumab in the first line setting and an ORR of 33% (95% CI 23.3–43.8) in the chemotherapy-refractory setting. Kaufman et al. (2016) , D’Angelo et al. (2021) , D’Angelo et al. (2020) . An ORR of 58% (95% CI 43.2–71.8) was observed with pembrolizumab in the first line setting. Nghiem et al. (2016) While anti-PD-L1 and anti-PD-1 monotherapy have been established as the standard of care for the treatment of advanced MCC, there are few systemic therapy options for those patients who have primary or acquired resistance and fail anti-PD(L)-1 treatment. Therefore, evaluating combination ipilimumab with nivolumab in patients who progress on anti-PD(L)-1 monotherapy as well as immunotherapy-naïve patients with MCC is warranted. Finally, since MCC is exceptionally radiosensitive and subablative hypofractionated radiotherapy may prime for anti-tumor immune responses, assessing combination ipilimumab with nivolumab in immunotherapy-naïve and refractory patients with or without the addition of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is worthy of investigation. Demaria, Golden, and Formenti (2015)\n\n\nStudy Design\n\nThis study received funding from the company and patients were enrolled from the Moffitt Cancer Center and Ohio State University James Cancer Hospital & Solove Research Institute. The investigators conducted an open-label, Phase II study with eligible patients randomized (1:1) to Group A or B, two experimental groups. Group A was designed to evaluate the clinical efficacy of combination ipilimumab plus nivolumab (Ipi/Nivo) in patients with unresectable, recurrent, or stage IV MCC and Group B was designed to determine the clinical efficacy of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) with combination Ipi/Nivo. Patients were stratified as ICI-naïve or following previous ICI failure (See Figure 1).\nSubjects were administered 240 mg intravenous (IV) nivolumab every 2 weeks and IV ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks. Patients randomized to Group B also received SBRT to a minimum of one tumor/lesion site at a dose of 24 Gy (3 fractions). The primary endpoint was the ORR in all eligible randomized patients per immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (irRECIST). See the tables below for key inclusion and exclusion criteria and secondary and exploratory endpoints.\n\n\n\n\nMain Findings\nResponses were observed in 18/25 (72%) of the subjects enrolled in Group A and 12/23 (52%) of the Group B patients. No statistically significant difference was reported between the two experimental groups (p value = 0.26). Analysis of the pooled ‘ICI-naïve’ versus ‘previous-ICI’ cohorts showed that 100% (95% CI 82-100; 22/22 subjects) of the ICI-naïve patients experienced an objective response while only 31% (95% CI 15-52; 8/26 subjects) of the previous-ICI patients had an objective response. Reported adverse events (AEs) were attributed to combination Ipi/Nivo with minimal SBRT-AEs observed. Any-Grade AEs occurred in 90% (40/50) of the subjects and Grade III/IV AEs were reported in 40% (10/25) of Group A patients and 32% ( 8/25) of Group B patients.\n\n\nDiscussion Points\nWe began Journal Club on November 7th, 2022 by administering a poll among the attendees via poll everywhere. Our goal was to conduct a brief survey before and after journal club discussions to determine the current practices of clinicians participating in the dialogue and whether review/discussion of the article would be ‘practice-changing.’ The following reflects the survey results of the poll administered at the start of the meeting:\n\n\n\n\nThe following reflects the survey results of the poll after our discussion and article review:\n\n\nSurvey results demonstrate that upon review and discussion of the article, the study is indeed “practice-changing” among the Cutaneous Oncology Interest Group Journal Club attendees. According to the poll, the vast majority of participants were not administering Ipi/Nivo for advanced MCC a year ago, and have never administered Ipi/Nivo as a first-line therapy for MCC. The post-discussion survey shows the majority of participants will change their treatment recommendations for MCC after review of the article, and are more likely now to recommend Ipi/Nivo in light of the data/results of the phase II trial. With an ORR of 100% in the ICI-naive cohort, potentially administering Ipi/Nivo in the first-line may be a reasonable management option moving forward. However, we must continue to weigh potential risks in the setting of increased toxicity with combination ICI versus monotherapy anti-PD(L)-1. Below, a table of the Grade III+ reported AEs from the avelumab, and pembrolizumab pivotal trials are listed alongside the grade III/IV AEs described in this study. Of note, the dosing regimen utilized in both Group A and B differs from that recommended for melanoma. Ipi was administered every 6 weeks at 1mg/kg with nivo every 2 weeks at 240mg and demonstrated clinical efficacy in MCC. This may likely be associated with reduced toxicity comparable to other dosing regimens, but appears higher than anti-PD(L)-1 mono therapy. However, direct comparisons across the trials with different numbers of enrolled patients and duration of therapies is cautioned (see Table below).\n\nA favored suggestion amongst the group for future directions included a multi-center, randomized clinical trial evaluating monotherapy anti-PD(L)-1 versus Ipi/Nivo (first-line) for advanced MCC, to assess efficacy and toxicity differences across the different regimens. That said, participants acknowledged that large comparative trials remain difficult to conduct in rare diseases such as MCC. Indeed, the two therapies approved in MCC (avelumab and pembrolizumab) came via single arm, non-comparative studies, with overall limited sample sizes (n = 88 and n = 50, respectively). In this context, the question of whether the present study should be sufficient for additional labeling information for ipilimumab and nivolumab was raised. When viewed in the backdrop of the evolving regulatory landscape on cutaneous oncology, the current study shares many of the features of recent studies that have led to label modifications in skin cancer Miller et al. (2022) . For example, an analysis of the evidence used to support labeled claims in skin cancer from 1949 to February 09, 2021 demonstrated that the most common endpoint incorporate some form of tumor response, such as ORR, used by Kim et al. Interestingly, the present study demonstrated a response rate that surpassed any previously reported BLA or NDA-enabling study. Of the 30 labeling modifications supported by results of studies incorporating tumor response, the observed ORR ranged from 15.9-83.3%, with a median of 34%Miller et al. (2022). In the first-line setting, Ipi/Nivo resulted in responses in an awe-inspiring 100% of patients. Furthermore, although limited in sample size, 50 enrolled subjects is also comparable to many studies supporting efficacy labelling modifications in skin cancer. There have been 62 studies with less than 100 subjects and 8 studies with 50 or fewer (range = 12-1127)Miller et al. (2022). In our opinion, the data presented by Kim et al. unequivocally establishes activity of ipilimumab/nivolumab in MCC. Moreover, the risk profile is appropriate for the disease context and observed efficacy. Given the importance of product labels in both informing clinicians and insurance coverage, the authors support a consideration of this data by the agency for a supplemental accelerated approval label of ipilimumab/nivolumab for advanced MCC in the first-line setting.\nIn the second-line setting, the study also provides rationale that Ipi/Nivo administered earlier in the course of the disease may offer more benefit. For example, a recent retrospective study (N=13) assessing real-world outcomes of Ipi/Nivo in ICI-refractory patients had an ORR of 0% but the majority of patients had an ECOG PS > 1 with advanced stage disease. Shalhout et al. (2022) . In the wake of an ORR of 31% in the phase II trial among the previous-ICI cohort, perhaps Ipi/Nivo up-front may become the standard of care for advanced MCC. Additional real-world studies, although limited by confounding and bias, may provide important supportive evidence of this claim. Currently, Ipi/Nivo in the second line may offer some to little benefit but this highlights the need for more therapeutic options for the refractory setting.\n\nThis site represents our opinions only.

M. Miller et al. (2022)) (Figure 1) .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1 - FDA Approvals in Melanoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the number of therapeutic options have increased, patients with macroscopic nodal metastases have a risk of melanoma-specific mortality that can approximate 75% (Gershenwald et al. (2017)). Recent strategies to improve outcomes in this high-risk subset of patients includes peri-operative administration of therapies previously shown to have efficacy in the locally advanced and unresectable setting. Post-operative monotherapy anti-PD1 has been shown to decrease the risk of recurrence by as much as 50% (Weber et al. (2017); Eggermont et al. (2018)). These studies led to the FDA-approval of nivolumab for resected Stage III disease in 2017 and pembrolizumab in 2019 (Figure 2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2 - FDA Approved Agents for Resected Melanoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPre-operative administration of systemic therapy has the potential to improve clinical outcomes by expanding antigen-specific immune response in the setting of an in situ tumor and preserved lymphatics (Liu et al. (2016)). Indeed, recently presented data at the 2022 Congress of the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) demonstrated the superiority of combining pre-operative with post-operative anti-PD1 compared to adjuvant-only anti-PD1 (Patel et al. (2022)). In the phase 2 study SWOG S1801, 313 patients with Stage IIIB-IV melanoma were randomized to either 3 doses of pre-operative pembrolizumab followed by 15 doses of adjuvant pembrolizumab or upfront surgery followed by 18 doses of post-operative pembrolizumab. Neoadjuvant plus adjuvant pembrolizumab was associated with a significantly higher event-free survival (EFS) (HR 0.59, 95% CI, 0.40-0.86) versus adjuvant-only therapy. In addition to potentially improving outcomes compared to post-operative-only therapy, by intensifying upfront treatment with neoadjuvant therapy, clinicians can utilize pathological information gained at the time of surgery to tailor post-operative management. The optimal neoadjuvant strategy, however, has not been identified; though several approaches have been evaluated. In a phase 2 study of 23 patients, ipilimumab plus nivolumab was compared to monotherapy nivolumab in the neoadjuvant setting (Amaria et al. (2018)) (Figure 3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3 - Neoadjuvant Ipi/Nivo vs. Nivolumab Study Design\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough limited in size, the study’s results suggested that three doses of ipilimumab 3 mg/kg plus nivolumab 1 mg/kg was associated with significant clinical activity, producing a complete pathological response (pCR) in 45% of patients. Despite not being adequately powered for comparison, the response seen with dual immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) appeared higher than with 4 doses of monotherapy anti-PD1 (pCR 25%). Combination Ipi/Nivo, however, resulted in grade 3-4 treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in 73% of patients.\nIn the OpACIN study, the combination of ipilimumab 3 mg/kg and nivolumab 1 mg/kg administered over two doses prior to surgery produced a pathological response in 7/9 (78%) patients, with 3/9 (33%) demonstrating a complete response (Blank et al. (2018))(Figure 4). Similar to the previous study, TEAEs were seen in 100% of patients, with 90% of patients experiencing grade 3-4 toxicity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4 - OpACIN Study Design\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an effort to identify the optimal combination dosing schedule of dual ICB, investigators of the OpACIN-neo study randomly assigned 105 patients to one of three combination regimens: Group A patients received two cycles of every three week (q3 week) ipilimumab 3 mg/kg plus nivolumab 1 mg/kg (Ipi 3/Nivo 1); Group B patients received two cycles of q3 week ipilimumab 1 mg/kg plus nivolumab 3 mg/kg (Ipi 1/Nivo 3) ; and Group C patients received two cycles of q3 week ipilimumab 3 mg/kg followed by two cycles of q2 week nivolumab 3 mg/kg (Ipi 3 followed by Nivo 3) (Rozeman et al. (2019)) (Figure 5). Recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates were similar between the 86 patients who were enrolled in the three groups, while grade 3-4 AEs were lower in the Ipi 1/Nivo 3 cohort (20%) compared to Ipi 3/Nivo 1 (40%) and the Ipi 3 followed by Nivo 3 (50%).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5 - OpACIN-neo Study Design\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven the favorable risk/benefit findings of Ipi 1/Nivo 3, an expansion cohort of OpACIN-neo was enrolled to investigate the role of assessing pathologic response in the index lymph node (ILN) in determining post-operative management (Figure 6). This study, named the PRADO Trial (Personalized response-directed surgery and adjuvant therapy after neoadjuvant ipilimumab and nivolumab in high-risk stage III melanoma), found that two pre-operative doses of Ipi 1/Nivo 3 yielded a 72% pathological response (PR) rate (49% pCR, 12% near-pCR, 11% partial PR).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6 - PRADO Study Design\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantly, patients that achieved a major pathological response (MPR, ≤10% viable tumor cells) and no further treatment had a recurrence-free survival (RFS) of 93% at 2 years compared to 64% for subjects that were pathological non-responders that went on to have a total lymph node dissection (TLND) and adjuvant systemic therapy. These results support the importance and role of pathological response assessment following upfront immunotherapy in post-operative management decisions, including the potential for de-escalation of therapy for patients with excellent pathological responses.\nAlthough there are no therapies with labelled indications in the neoadjuvant setting, these studies support the clinical utility of pre-operative immune checkpoint blockade (Table 1). Given the favorable responses seen with neoadjuvant treatment, the aforementioned clinical trials highlight the goal of continued investigation to find new approaches that augment immunological anti-tumor responses and minimize off-target autoimmunity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1 - Summary of Neoadjuvant Studies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudy\nPre-Operative Intervention\nPathological Response\nAny Grade AE\nGrade 3-4 AE\n\n\n\n\nOpACIN Blank et al.

Approval was based on data from the phase 2-3 study RELATIVITY-047, in which combination Nivo/Rela was associated with improved progression-free survial (PFS) compared to single-agent nivolumab (10.12 vs. 4.63 months, HR 0.75 (95% CI, 0.62 - 0.92)) (Tawbi et al.

Any grade toxicity was seen in 97.2% of patients treated with combination therapy vs. 94.4% single-agent nivolumab. Grade 3-4 AEs were seen in 40.3% of patients who received Nivo/Rela vs. 33.4% of those administered nivolumab monotherapy. Based on the improved PFS and acceptable safety profile seen in RELATIVITY-047, the OpACIN-neo investigators opened a new arm of NCT02519322 to evaluate the pCR rate, safety and efficacy of peri-operative Nivo/Rela."

PMID: 36094839\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nOn October 7th, 2022, the multi-institutional Cutaneous Oncology Interest Group Journal Club reviewed the recently published New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) article “Neoadjuvant Cemiplimab for Stage II to IV Cutaneous Squamous-Cell Carcinoma” (Gross et al. 2022). Participants included clinicians and investigators from Massachusetts General Hospital, Mass Eye and Ear Infirmary, Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH), George Washington Cancer Center, the National Institute of Health, University of Pennsylvania and Moffitt Cancer Center. Importantly, the comments in this article represent the views of the authors of this Perspectives on the Science piece after the Journal Club review. It does not represent views of any other members of the Interest Group or the affiliated institutions. Here, we provide a summary of the discussion regarding this important contribution to the literature. Of note, several participants of the Journal Club were investigators of this study and authors on the NEJM article.\n\n\nBackground for the Study\nAlthough the vast majority of cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (CSCC) are treated and cured with local destruction or surgical excision, a subset of patients have poor outcomes, including regional, nodal and distant metastases. Approximately 6% of patients with CSCC will go on to develop nodal or distant disease, resulting in a mortality of 1.5-2% (Patel et al. 2021; Thompson et al. 2016). Consequently, there is an unmet need to find alternative treatment strategies to improve outcomes in patients with high-risk CSCC.\nThe therapeutic landscape for CSCC has rapidly evolved over the last five years (Shalhout et al. 2021, 2023; D. M. Miller et al. 2022) (Figure 1). Recently, clinical trial data has lead to the approval of immune checkpoint inhibitors for locally advanced and metastatic CSCC (Migden et al. 2018; Grob et al. 2020).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Evolving treatment landscape in CSCC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObjective response rates for advanced disease ranging from 46-51% and 35-50% in EMPOWER-CSCC-1 and KEYNOTE-629, respectively, led to the hypotheses tested by Gross et al. that pre-operative anti-PD-1 would improve pathological response rates at the time of surgical excision.\n\n\nStudy Design\nThe investigators conducted a company-sponsored, phase 2, multi-center, non-randomized study involving 79 patients with high-risk disease. Patients were eligible if they had resectable Stage II or greater disease. Of note, only Stage II patients with primary lesions >3 cm were eligible. Subjects received up to four doses of cemiplimab 350 mg every three weeks, followed by surgical resection. The primary endpoint of the study was a pathological complete response (pCR) rate. The null hypotheses was a pCR rate of 25%. Following surgery, investigators were allowed to decide on a post-operative course that included observation, adjuvant radiotherapy or continued cemiplimab.\n\n\nMain Findings\nPathological complete responses were seen in 40 patients (51%), with another 10 patients exhibiting a major pathological response (defined as <10% viable tumor cells seen on the specimen). Adverse events (AEs) were seen in 87% of patients, with grade three or greater AEs occurring in 18% of patients. Four patients died during the study.\n\n\nDiscussion Points\nThe consensus amongst the Interest Group was that this study is indeed practice-changing. A few participants were already incorporating pre-operative immunecheckpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy for some of their highest-risk patients prior the publication of these results. Other participants that were primarily using ICI therapy per the FDA indications (e.g. locally advanced or metastatic disease) stated that they would consider implementing ICI earlier in the disease journey as a result of this study. Participants, however, stressed the importance of assessing the benefit-to-risk ratio. The absolute risk of poor outcomes for various stages of disease studied in this population varies and, in many cases, remain incompletely clarified. This may be due to CSCC not being part of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program. Therefore prognostic estimates of local recurrence, nodal and distant metastases, as well as disease-specific death, have come largely from single-institution datasets and are limited. For example, a 2019 study by Ruiz et al. evaluated the prognosis of 459 patients at BWH (Ruiz et al. 2019). The 10-year cumulative incidence (CIN) rate of local recurrence (LR), nodal metastases (NM) and disease-specific death (DSD) for AJCC Stage II disease was 15.8, 12.2 and 7.6%, respectively in the 36 tumors evaluated. For the 119 T3 tumors (e.g. AJCC Stage III), the 10-year CIN rates for LR, NM and DSD were 19.7, 14.1 and 9.3%, respectively.\nThus the benefits of pre-operative ICI must be weighed in the setting of toxicity. The current study had 4 fatalities, an unusually high proportion, given 79 total subjects. Typical estimated rates of ICI-related mortality are 1:200. Although only one subject’s death was considered possibly related to treatment, all four died of cardiac-related events. These subjects were advanced in age (73, 82, 85 and 93 years old) and had underlying heart disease; thus, making attributions of treatment relatedness challenging. However, we must continue to be vigilant of possible treatment-related effects of ICI therapy given the advanced age of the CSCC population and emerging data that anti-PD-1 therapies may be associated with increases in cardiovascular events and atherosclerotic plaque disruption (Drobni et al. 2020).\nIn the wake of this impactful study, several questions remain. These include the optimal number of doses of pre-operative ICI. Comparable path CR rates were observed in a pilot study two pre-operative doses of cemiplimab in Stage II-IV CSCC (Ferrarotto et al. 2021). Twenty-two percent of the subjects in the study did not received all four doses and 11% did not undergo surgery in the protocol-specified window. Thus, identifying the optimal number of pre-operative doses of ICI therapy remains critical. In addition, understanding the clinical benefit of pre-operative ICI in some of the most at-risk patients is necessary, including those with incompetent immune systems. Furthermore, integrating pre-operative ICIs into a treatment landscape of post-operative systemic therapy, adjuvant radiation therapy or salvage treatment upon disease recurrence remains important unmet need.\n\nThis site represents our opinions only.

Rohaan et al. NEJM. 2022 Dec 8;387(23):2113-2125.\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nOn January 9th, 2023, the multi-institutional Cutaneous Oncology Interest Group Journal Club reviewed the recently published NEJM article “Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocyte Therapy or Ipilimumab in Advanced Melanoma”(Rohaan et al. 2022). Participants included clinicians and investigators from Massachusetts General Hospital, Mass Eye and Ear, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, the National Institutes of Health, George Washington Medical Center, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and the Northwestern Feinberg School of Medicine. Importantly, the comments in this article represent the views of the authors of this Perspectives on the Science piece after the Journal Club. It does not represent views of any other members of the Interest Group or the affiliated institutions. In this article we provide a summary of the discussion regarding this important contribution to the literature.\n\n\nBackground for the Study\nTreatment options for melanoma have advanced greatly in the last several years and continue to evolve (Figure 1). Landmark studies such as KEYNOTE-001/006 and CheckMate-066 have led to single-agent immunotherapy with anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors becoming a first-line treatment options for advanced, unresectable melanoma (Figure 2).(Hamid et al. 2019; Robert et al. 2015; Robert, Ribas, et al. 2019; Schachter et al. 2017; Petrella et al. 2017) Subsequent studies such as CheckMate-067 and RELATIVITY-047 have positioned dual immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) with aPD-1/aCTLA-4 and aPD-1/aLAG-3 monoclonal antibodies as additional options in the front-line setting for appropriate patients. (Wolchok et al. 2017; Tawbi et al. 2022; Long et al. 2022) In addition combined BRAF and MEK inhibition may be efficacious for melanomas with BRAF mutations(Robert, Grob, et al. 2019; Dummer et al. 2018)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Evolving treatment landscape in melanoma.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Front-line therapy in advanced melanoma.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite these treatment measures, primary and acquired resistance is common for all front-line therapeutic options. Unfortunately, outcomes with ICI and targeted therapies in the second-line setting have been disappointing (Figure 3). (Atkins et al. 2023; Silva et al. 2021) Subsequently, the 5 year mortality rate in patients with stage IV disease is 50%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Efficacy of second-line therapy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdoptive cell therapy with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) has shown clinical utility in melanoma since the 1990s (S. A. Rosenberg et al. 1994). In this process, tumor-resident T cells from a patient’s tumor are extracted and expanded ex-vivo. The patient is administered preparative lymphodepleting chemotherapy, often with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, before the T-cells are infused back into the patient with interleukin-2 to further enhance in vivo expansion of cells and boost the antitumor response. While results have varied, multiple phase I and II trials have shown response rates around 50%.(Berg et al. 2020; M. E. Dudley et al. 2008; Steven A. Rosenberg et al. 2011; Besser et al. 2010; Ellebaek et al. 2012; Andersen et al. 2016; M. Dudley et al. 2022; Pilon-Thomas et al. 2012) Several of these studies are summarized in Figure 4. C-144-01, a recently reported study of LN-144 TIL therapy in patients who failed anti-PD-1 immunotherapy reported an objective response rate of 31.4% in a pooled analysis of consecutive cohorts, highlighting potential utility of TIL therapy for patients who have had disease progression on first-line options (Sarnaik et al. 2021).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4. Summary of previous TIL studies in advanced melanoma.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudy Design\nThis was a phase III, multicenter, open-label trial including patients age 18-75 with unresectable stage IIIC or IV melanoma. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive TIL or anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 therapy (ipilimumab) (Figure 5). Patients assigned to the TIL group underwent a metastasectomy for retrieval and expansion of TILs, then received nonmyeloablative, lymphodepleting chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine. Single intravenous adoptive transfer of TILs was followed by high-dose interleukin-2 every 8 hours, for a maximum of 15 doses. Patients in the ipilimumab group received 3 mg per kilogram of body weight every 3 weeks, for up to 4 doses. The primary end point was progression-free survival, defined as the time from randomization to first disease progression or death. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), objective response, complete response, overall survival, health-related quality of life, and safety.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5. Study design.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMain Findings\n168 patients (86% with disease refractory to anti–programmed death 1 treatment) were assigned to receive TILs (84 patients) or ipilimumab (84 patients). Median PFS in the TIL group was 7.2 months, significantly longer than 3.1 months in the ipilimumab group. Objective response rates were 49% in TIL group and 21% (95% CI, 13 to 32) of patients in ipilimumab group. 20% of patients in the TIL group achieved complete response, compared to 7% in the ipilimumab group. At the time of the data cutoff, the overall median follow-up was 33.0 months. Median overall survival was 25.8 months in the TIL group and 18.9 months in the ipilimumab group. In regards to safety, treatment related adverse events occurred in all patients in the TIL group and in 96% of those in the ipilimumab group. All patients in the TIL group experienced grade 3 adverse events, due to chemotherapy-related myelosuppression, while 57% of patients in the ipilimumab group experienced grade 3 or higher adverse events. Overall, patients in the TIL group had higher mean health-related quality of life scores than those in the ipilimumab group, though scores varied for different symptoms.\n\n\nDiscussion Points\nImproving outcomes for patients with ICI-refractory disease is a critical need. The treatment landscape is evolving and clinicians currently only have a few options to choose from when patients progress on first-line monotherapy anti-PD-1. Commercially-available options include monotherapy ipilimumab, dual ICB with ipilimumab/nivolumab or ipilimumab/relatlimab and combination targeted therapies for patients with actionable BRAF V600 mutations. When provided with a clinical vignette of ICI-refractory wild-type melanoma, the vast majority of the diverse group of COIG attendees at the January 9th journal club that treat melanoma (Figure 6) responded that they would have selected combination ipilimumab/nivolumab (Figure 7). Given the patient’s ECOG status of 2, one respondent replied that they have recommended combination CTLA-4/LAG-3 in this case. None of the practioners would have recommended monotherapy ipilimumab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6. Journal club attendees\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7. Management strategies of ICI-refractory melanoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttendees recognized that while dual ICB and combination oncogene-targeted therapies can produce responses in the second-line and beyond, meaningful clinical benefit is limited to a fraction of patients. For many years, TIL therapy has produced intriguing results in small, non-comparative investigations. Given the lack of commercial approval, TIL therapy has not been widely adopted. However, the majority of melanoma clinicians at the January 9th COIG JC have recommended TIL therapy previously as part of their practice (Figure 8).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8. Experience with TIL therapy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurthermore, most were affiliates at institutions with a cell therapy group capable of delivery TIL therapy (Figure 9).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9. Cell therapy capabilities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThus, the results from Rohaan et al were of a considerable interest. TIL therapy was associated with a clinically meaningful 50% reduction in the hazard for progression or death compared with monotherapy ipilimumab. Despite the majority of patients being treated previously with immunotherapy, nearly one-half of the patients experienced a response to TIL therapy. Importantly, responses were durable in the majority of patients that experienced an initial response. These data corroborate the findings in C-144-01, in which 15-20% of the heavily pre-treated cohort experienced durable responses following administration of lifileucel (Sarnaik et al. 2021). Taking collectively, TIL therapy is likely to become a standard option in the field. Indeed, Iovance, the sponsor of C-144-01, is expecting the rolling Biologics Licences Application (BLA) submission of lifileucel to be completed in the first half of 2023. Interestingly, while the attendees verbalized that the study by Rohaan et al. was a landmark investigation, less than half replied that it would change their practice (Figure 10).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10. Practice changing nature of the study\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndeed, when presented with the same case of refractory advanced melanoma, but given the option of having TIL therapy available, only 1/9 clinicians responded that they would recommend TIL therapy (Figure 11).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11. Case one revisted\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly a minority of respondents replied that if approved, TIL therapy would become their preferred treatment strategy for PD-1 refractory melanoma (Figure 12)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12. Implementation of TIL therapy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite the promise of TIL therapy, there are several challenges with its adoption and implementation. Most notably are the risks associate with its use. Grade 3 or higher treatment related adverse event (TRAEs) were nearly universal in both C-144-01 and the study by Rohaan et al. Granted the vast majority were expected from the lymphodepleting agents used as part of the conditioning regimen and were transient and manageable. Nevertheless, 86% experienced the potentially life-threatening complication febrile neutropenia and 10% of patients required transfer to the intensive care unit. When compared to the other treatment options for refractory disease, TIL therapy appears to offer a trade off of enhanced efficacy at the expense of increased toxicity (Figure 13).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13. Risk benefit of therapeutic strategies for PD-1 refractory disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother consideration and potential barrier to TIL therapy are the logistics required for preparation. Adequate and accessible tumor tissue is needed, as is several weeks for cultivation and expansion of donor cells. Therefore, TILs may be less appropirate for patients with hard-to-access metastases and/or rapidly progressing disease. Thus, the use of TIL therapy is likely to be individualized and utilized in centers with experienced practioners. Nevertheless, the studies by Sarnaik et al. and Rohaan et al. represent important contributions to the field and will likely lead to clinicians having additional options for their patients in the near future.\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\nThis Perspectives on the Science piece was published using Quarto®.
