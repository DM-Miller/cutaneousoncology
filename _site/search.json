    "text": "Background for the Study\n\n\n\nThe therapeutic landscape in melanoma has evolved significantly since the first approval in 1967, with 48 US FDA actions for therapies indicated for the adjuvant, locally advanced and metastatic setting (Figure 1).2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1 - FDA Approvals in Melanoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the number of therapeutic options have increased, patients with macroscopic nodal metastases have a risk of melanoma-specific mortality that can approximate 75%.3 Recent strategies to improve outcomes in this high-risk subset of patients includes peri-operative administration of therapies previously shown to have efficacy in the locally advanced and unresectable setting. Post-operative monotherapy anti-PD1 has been shown to decrease the risk of recurrence by as much as 50%.4 5. These studies led to the FDA-approval of nivolumab for resected Stage III disease in 2017 and pembrolizumab in 2019 (Figure 2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2 - FDA Approved Agents for Resected Melanoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPre-operative administration of systemic therapy has the potential to improve clinical outcomes by expanding antigen-specific immune response in the setting of an in situ tumor and preserved lymphatics.6 Indeed, recently presented data at the 2022 Congress of the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) demonstrated the superiority of combining pre-operative with post-operative anti-PD1 compared to adjuvant-only anti-PD1.7 In the phase 2 study SWOG S1801, 313 patients with Stage IIIB-IV melanoma were randomized to either 3 doses of pre-operative pembrolizumab followed by 15 doses of adjuvant pembrolizumab or upfront surgery followed by 18 doses of post-operative pembrolizumab. Neoadjuvant plus adjuvant pembrolizumab was associated with a significantly higher event-free survival (EFS) (HR 0.59, 95% CI, 0.40-0.86) versus adjuvant-only therapy. In addition to potentially improving outcomes compared to post-operative-only therapy, by intensifying upfront treatment with neoadjuvant therapy, clinicians can utilize pathological information gained at the time of surgery to tailor post-operative management. The optimal neoadjuvant strategy, however, has not been identified; though several approaches have been evaluated. In a phase 2 study of 23 patients, ipilimumab plus nivolumab was compared to monotherapy nivolumab in the neoadjuvant setting.8 (Figure 3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3 - Neoadjuvant Ipi/Nivo vs. Nivolumab Study Design\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough limited in size, the study’s results suggested that three doses of ipilimumab 3 mg/kg plus nivolumab 1 mg/kg was associated with significant clinical activity, producing a complete pathological response (pCR) in 45% of patients. Despite not being adequately powered for comparison, the response seen with dual immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) appeared higher than with 4 doses of monotherapy anti-PD1 (pCR 25%). Combination Ipi/Nivo, however, resulted in grade 3-4 treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in 73% of patients.\nIn the OpACIN study, the combination of ipilimumab 3 mg/kg and nivolumab 1 mg/kg administered over two doses prior to surgery produced a pathological response in 7/9 (78%) patients, with 3/9 (33%) demonstrating a complete response (Figure 4).9 Similar to the previous study, TEAEs were seen in 100% of patients, with 90% of patients experiencing grade 3-4 toxicity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4 - OpACIN Study Design\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an effort to identify the optimal combination dosing schedule of dual ICB, investigators of the OpACIN-neo study randomly assigned 105 patients to one of three combination regimens: Group A patients received two cycles of every three week (q3 week) ipilimumab 3 mg/kg plus nivolumab 1 mg/kg (Ipi 3/Nivo 1); Group B patients received two cycles of q3 week ipilimumab 1 mg/kg plus nivolumab 3 mg/kg (Ipi 1/Nivo 3) ; and Group C patients received two cycles of q3 week ipilimumab 3 mg/kg followed by two cycles of q2 week nivolumab 3 mg/kg (Ipi 3 followed by Nivo 3) (Figure 5).10. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates were similar between the 86 patients who were enrolled in the three groups, while grade 3-4 AEs were lower in the Ipi 1/Nivo 3 cohort (20%) compared to Ipi 3/Nivo 1 (40%) and the Ipi 3 followed by Nivo 3 (50%).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5 - OpACIN-neo Study Design\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven the favorable risk/benefit findings of Ipi 1/Nivo 3, an expansion cohort of OpACIN-neo was enrolled to investigate the role of assessing pathologic response in the index lymph node (ILN) in determining post-operative management (Figure 6). This study, named the PRADO Trial (Personalized response-directed surgery and adjuvant therapy after neoadjuvant ipilimumab and nivolumab in high-risk stage III melanoma), found that two pre-operative doses of Ipi 1/Nivo 3 yielded a 72% pathological response (PR) rate (49% pCR, 12% near-pCR, 11% partial PR).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6 - PRADO Study Design\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantly, patients that achieved a major pathological response (MPR, ≤10% viable tumor cells) and no further treatment had a recurrence-free survival (RFS) of 93% at 2 years compared to 64% for subjects that were pathological non-responders that went on to have a total lymph node dissection (TLND) and adjuvant systemic therapy. These results support the importance and role of pathological response assessment following upfront immunotherapy in post-operative management decisions, including the potential for de-escalation of therapy for patients with excellent pathological responses.\nAlthough there are no therapies with labelled indications in the neoadjuvant setting, these studies support the clinical utility of pre-operative immune checkpoint blockade (Table 1). Given the favorable responses seen with neoadjuvant treatment, the aforementioned clinical trials highlight the goal of continued investigation to find new approaches that augment immunological anti-tumor responses and minimize off-target autoimmunity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1 - Summary of Neoadjuvant Studies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudy\nPre-Operative Intervention\nPathological Response\nAny Grade AE\nGrade 3-4 AE\n\n\n\n\nOpACIN9\nIpi 3 mg/kg/Nivo 1 mg/kg x 2 doses\n78% (33% pCR)\n100%\n90%\n\n\nNCT025193228\nIpi 3 mg/kg/Nivo 1 mg/kg x 3 doses  Nivo 3 mg/kg x 4 doses\n45% pCR  25% pCR\n91%\n73%\n\n\nOpACIN-neo10\nIpi 3 mg/kg/Nivo 1 mg/kgx 2 doses  Ipi 1 mg/kg/Nivo 3 mg/kg x 2 doses  Ipi 3 mg/kg x 2 doses/Nivo 3 mg/kg x 2 doses\n80% (47% pCR)  77% (57% pCR)  65% (23% pCR)\n97%  97%  90%\n40%  20%  50%\n\n\nPRADO11\nIpi 1 mg/kg/Nivo 3 mg/kg x 2 doses\n72% (49%)\n97%\n22%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG-3) molecule is a cell surface protein found on T-cells and engages the MHC complex located on antigen-presenting cells (APCs).

Approval was based on data from the phase 2-3 study RELATIVITY-047, in which combination Nivo/Rela was associated with improved progression-free survial (PFS) compared to single-agent nivolumab (10.12 vs. 4.63 months, HR 0.75 (95% CI, 0.62 - 0.92)).12 Compared to nivolumab monotherapy, Nivo/Rela was associated with a higher, but overall reasonable safety profile. Any grade toxicity was seen in 97.2% of patients treated with combination therapy vs. 94.4% single-agent nivolumab. Grade 3-4 AEs were seen in 40.3% of patients who received Nivo/Rela vs. 33.4% of those administered nivolumab monotherapy. Based on the improved PFS and acceptable safety profile seen in RELATIVITY-047, the OpACIN-neo investigators opened a new arm of NCT02519322 to evaluate the pCR rate, safety and efficacy of peri-operative Nivo/Rela."

    "text": "Discussion Points\nWe began Journal Club by administering a poll among the attendees. Our goal was to conduct a brief survey before and after journal club discussions to determine the current practices of clinicians participating in the dialogue and how the current article might affect their practice. The attendees on December 2nd, 2022 represented a diverse mix of clinical providers and non-clinical researchers (Figure 9).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9 - Journal Club Attendees\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to begin a conversation about the evolving approach to resectable melanoma, attendees were queried as to how they would have likely managed a case of Stage IIIC melanoma, one year ago (Figure 10). Options included surgery only, surgery and adjuvant therapy, as well as pre-operative systemic therapy followed by a tailored post-operative approach based on the pathologic response seen on resection. Due to diverse nature of the COIG, nine respondents felt comfortable making a treatment recommendation for regionally metastatic melanoma (7 members did not). All nine clinicians (100%) replied that 1-year ago they would have recommended surgery followed by adjuvant anti-PD1. None of the respondents would have utilized a neoadjuvant approach.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10 - Management Strategies of Stage IIIC Melanoma 1-Year Ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven the topic of the current paper, we surveyed how many clinicians had previously recommended the use of neoadjuvant immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) for resectable melanoma. Of the 8 respondents, 75% responded that they had incorporated pre-operative ICI into at least one patient’s treatment strategy (Figure 11).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11 - Use of Neoadjuvant Immunotherapy for Resectable Melanoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe majority of clinicians (5/8), however, had not previously recommended neoadjuvant Ipi/Nivo for resectable melanoma (Figure 12). Concern for significant toxicity was cited as a common reason for not incorporating Ipi/Nivo into a neoadjuvant management plan for high-risk, but resectable melanoma. That said, clinicians in the group acknowledged the potential of neoadjuvant strategies to enhance pathologic responses and improve long-term outcomes while improving on the toxicity profile seen with neoadjuvant Ipi/Nivo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12 - Use of Neoadjuvant Ipi/Nivo for Resectable Melanoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the current study was fairly limited in size (n = 30), there was a generally favorable response to its outcomes and toxicity data. Similar to what was observed in previous neoadjuvant studies, pathological response to neoadjuvant treatment was associated with a significantly improved RFS rate at 2 years (92% vs. 55%). Thus, pathologic response likely serves as an early indicator of long-term outcome. However, unlike the PRADO study, however, all patients received post-operative adjuvant Nivo/Rela. Therefore, a follow up study will be necessary to learn if pathologic response can be used to de-escalate post-surgical therapy. Given that all of the grade 3-4 AEs to Nivo/Rela occurred in the post-operative setting, omission of adjuvant immunotherapy may preclude serious toxicity.\nDespite the limitations of the current study (e.g. small cohort, non-randomized design), the COIG participants who treat melanoma indicated that these data would affect their current practice. The vast majority (88%) replied that this paper would change their practice (Figure 13).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13 - Practice Impact of “Neoadjuvant relatlimab and nivolumab in resectable melanoma”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen presented with the same clinical example as above (BRAF wild type, T3bN1bM0 scalp melanoma) 6/7 of the respondents answered that they would now recommend neoadjuvant Nivo/Rela (Figure 14). Despite the fact that 1 year ago, NCT02519322, OpACIN and OpACIN-neo had been published, none of the clinicians responded that they would have incorporated neoadjuvant therapy in the Stage IIIC melanoma vignette. There are likely several factors that underlie this change in approach to the management of resectable melanoma. Over the last year several studies have been either presented (SWOG S1801) or published (PRADO, the current study) supporting the clinical utility of pre-operative immune therapy for resectable disease. Furthermore, similar data supporting the use of neoadjuvant ICI have been demonstrated in other skin cancers such as Merkel cell carcinoma13 and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.14 Since the majority of the practioners present at the meeting also manage patients with non-melanoma skin cancer, they are aware of the body of evidence in skin cancer supporting pre-operative ICI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14 - Current Approach to Stage IIIC Melanoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticipants acknowledged the challenges in selecting a management strategy for resectable melanoma, given the promising results of several small neoadjuvant investigation, with varying treatment approaches. Currently, clinicians have a variety of options including on-label post-operative anti-PD1 monotherapy and off-label upfront therapy with single-agent anti-PD1 or dual ICB with anti-PD1/anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD1/anti-LAG-3 combinations. Consequently, there is a critical need for a randomized, comparative study to help evaluate which of the various strategies yields the optimal clinical benefit. However, until those studies are performed, clinicians must choose which of the following management approaches will best serve their current patients. Based on the efficacy and toxicity data from this study relative to the existing data (Table 2),\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2 - Neoadjuvant Study Summary Updated With Current Study\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudy\nPre-Operative Intervention\nPathological Response\nAny Grade AE\nGrade 3-4 AE\n\n\n\n\nOpACIN9\nIpi 3 mg/kg/Nivo 1 mg/kg x 2 doses\n78% (33% pCR)\n100%\n90%\n\n\nNCT025193228\nIpi 3 mg/kg/Nivo 1 mg/kg x 3 doses  Nivo 3 mg/kg x 4 doses\n45% pCR  25% pCR\n91%\n73%\n\n\nOpACIN-neo10\nIpi 3 mg/kg/Nivo 1 mg/kgx 2 doses  Ipi 1 mg/kg/Nivo 3 mg/kg x 2 doses  Ipi 3 mg/kg x 2 doses/Nivo 3 mg/kg x 2 doses\n80% (47% pCR)  77% (57% pCR)  65% (23% pCR)\n97%  97%  90%\n40%  20%  50%\n\n\nPRADO11\nIpi 1 mg/kg/Nivo 3 mg/kg x 2 doses\n72% (49%)\n97%\n22%\n\n\nNeo Nivo Rela1\nNivo 480mg/Rela 160 mg x 2 doses\n70% (57% pCR)\nNA\n26%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n62% (5/8) of the clinical respondents indicated that Nivo/Rela would now become their preferred regimen when a neoadjuvant strategy was incorporated into a patient’s management plan for resectable melanoma (Figure 15).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15 - Incorporating Neoadjuvant Nivo/Rela Into Current Practice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn important question remains: for which patients should a neoadjuvant approach be adopted? Until there is data that provides evidence that upfront systemic treatment for disease that is potentially curable by surgery alone improves disease-specific survival as compared to administration of the very same intervention at the time of first recurrence, an argument can be made that intensifying treatment for all patients with resectable disease unnecessarily exposes many patients to potentially serious toxicity. To emphasize this point, 60% of the patients in neoadjuvant nivo/rela study had Stage IIIB, which was associated with a 10-year melanoma-specific survival of 88% back in 20173. Thus, the vast majority of these patients would likely have been cured without upfront systemic therapy. This reality highlights the need to identify biomarkers to further risk-stratify those patients who might benefit from early treatment intensification, such as neoadjuvant immune therapy."

Kim et al. Lancet 2022 Sep 24;400(10357):1008-1019. PMID: 36108657\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nOn November 7th, 2022, the multi-institutional Cutaneous Oncology Interest Group Journal Club reviewed the recently published Lancet article “Combined Nivolumab and Ipilimumab with or without Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy for Advanced Merkel cell carcinoma: A Randomised, Open Label, Phase 2 Trial”.1 Participants included clinicians and investigators from Massachusetts General Hospital, Mass Eye and Ear Infirmary, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, University of Washington School of Medicine, the National Institute of Health, Northwestern University, University of Pennsylvania and Moffitt Cancer Center. Importantly, the comments in this article represent the views of the authors of this Perspectives on the Science piece after the Journal Club. It does not represent views of any other members of the Interest Group or the affiliated institutions. In this article we provide a summary of the discussion regarding this important contribution to the literature. Of note, one participant of the Journal Club is an investigator of the discussed study and an author on the Lancet article.\n\n\nBackground for the Study\nMerkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare cutaneous neuroendocrine carcinoma often associated with chronic ultraviolet light exposure, a suppressed or weakened immune system, and/or the Merkel Cell Polyoma Virus (MCPyV). This aggressive skin cancer has a high distant metastasis rate, associated with a poor prognosis.\nThe advent of immunotherapeutics and the regulatory approvals of anti-PD-L1 and anti-PD-1 agents for MCC have revolutionized the treatment landscape. Avelumab received an accelerated FDA approval for metastatic MCC in 2017. Pembrolizumab was approved by the FDA in 2018 for the treatment of recurrent, locally advanced, and metastatic MCC. Immunotherapy is associated with durable responses in MCC and pivotal trials reported an objective response rate (ORR) of 39.7% (95% CI 30.7-49.2) for avelumab in the first line setting and an ORR of 33% (95% CI 23.3–43.8) in the chemotherapy-refractory setting.2 ,3 ,4 . An ORR of 58% (95% CI 43.2–71.8) was observed with pembrolizumab in the first line setting.5 While anti-PD-L1 and anti-PD-1 monotherapy have been established as the standard of care for the treatment of advanced MCC, there are few systemic therapy options for those patients who have primary or acquired resistance and fail anti-PD(L)-1 treatment. Therefore, evaluating combination ipilimumab with nivolumab in patients who progress on anti-PD(L)-1 monotherapy as well as immunotherapy-naïve patients with MCC is warranted. Finally, since MCC is exceptionally radiosensitive and subablative hypofractionated radiotherapy may prime for anti-tumor immune responses, assessing combination ipilimumab with nivolumab in immunotherapy-naïve and refractory patients with or without the addition of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is worthy of investigation.6\n\n\nStudy Design\n\nThis study received funding from the company and patients were enrolled from the Moffitt Cancer Center and Ohio State University James Cancer Hospital & Solove Research Institute. The investigators conducted an open-label, Phase II study with eligible patients randomized (1:1) to Group A or B, two experimental groups. Group A was designed to evaluate the clinical efficacy of combination ipilimumab plus nivolumab (ipi-nivo) in patients with unresectable, recurrent, or stage IV MCC and Group B was designed to determine the clinical efficacy of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) with combination ipi-nivo. Patients were stratified as ICI-naïve or following previous ICI failure (See Figure 1).\nSubjects were administered 240 mg intravenous (IV) nivolumab every 2 weeks and IV ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks. Patients randomized to Group B also received SBRT to a minimum of one tumor/lesion site at a dose of 24 Gy (3 fractions). The primary endpoint was the ORR in all eligible randomized patients per immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (irRECIST). See the tables below for key inclusion and exclusion criteria and secondary and exploratory endpoints.\n\n\n\n\nMain Findings\nResponses were observed in 18/25 (72%) of the subjects enrolled in Group A and 12/23 (52%) of the Group B patients. No statistically significant difference was reported between the two experimental groups (p value = 0.26). Analysis of the pooled ‘ICI-naïve’ versus ‘previous-ICI’ cohorts showed that 100% (95% CI 82-100; 22/22 subjects) of the ICI-naïve patients experienced an objective response while only 31% (95% CI 15-52; 8/26 subjects) of the previous-ICI patients had an objective response. Reported adverse events (AEs) were attributed to combination ipi-nivo with minimal SBRT-AEs observed. Any-Grade AEs occurred in 90% (40/50) of the subjects and Grade III/IV AEs were reported in 40% (10/25) of Group A patients and 32% ( 8/25) of Group B patients.\n\n\nDiscussion Points\nWe began Journal Club on November 7th, 2022 by administering a poll among the attendees via poll everywhere. Our goal was to conduct a brief survey before and after journal club discussions to determine the current practices of clinicians participating in the dialogue and whether review/discussion of the article would be ‘practice-changing.’ The following reflects the survey results of the poll administered at the start of the meeting:\n\n\n\n\nThe following reflects the survey results of the poll after our discussion and article review:\n\n\nSurvey results demonstrate that upon review and discussion of the article, the study is indeed “practice-changing” among the Cutaneous Oncology Interest Group Journal Club attendees. According to the poll, the vast majority of participants were not administering ipi-nivo for advanced MCC a year ago, and have never administered ipi-nivo as a first-line therapy for MCC. The post-discussion survey shows the majority of participants will change their treatment recommendations for MCC after review of the article, and are more likely now to recommend ipi-nivo in light of the data/results of the phase II trial. With an ORR of 100% in the ICI-naive cohort, potentially administering ipi-nivo in the first-line may be a reasonable management option moving forward. However, we must continue to weigh potential risks in the setting of increased toxicity with combination ICI versus monotherapy anti-PD(L)-1. Below, a table of the Grade III+ reported AEs from the avelumab, and pembrolizumab pivotal trials are listed alongside the grade III/IV AEs described in this study. Of note, the dosing regimen utilized in both Group A and B differs from that recommended for melanoma. Ipi was administered every 6 weeks at 1mg/kg with nivo every 2 weeks at 240mg and demonstrated clinical efficacy in MCC. This may likely be associated with reduced toxicity comparable to other dosing regimens, but appears higher than anti-PD(L)-1 mono therapy. However, direct comparisons across the trials with different numbers of enrolled patients and duration of therapies is cautioned (see Table below).\n\nA favored suggestion amongst the group for future directions included a multi-center, randomized clinical trial evaluating monotherapy anti-PD(L)-1 versus ipi-nivo (first-line) for advanced MCC, to assess efficacy and toxicity differences across the different regimens. That said, participants acknowledged that large comparative trials remain difficult to conduct in rare diseases such as MCC. Indeed, the two therapies approved in MCC (avelumab and pembrolizumab) came via single arm, non-comparative studies, with overall limited sample sizes (n = 88 and n = 50, respectively). In this context, the question of whether the present study should be sufficient for additional labeling information for ipilimumab and nivolumab was raised. When viewed in the backdrop of the evolving regulatory landscape on cutaneous oncology, the current study shares many of the features of recent studies that have led to label modifications in skin cancer7 . For example, an analysis of the evidence used to support labeled claims in skin cancer from 1949 to February 09, 2021 demonstrated that the most common endpoint incorporate some form of tumor response, such as ORR, used by Kim et al. Interestingly, the present study demonstrated a response rate that surpassed any previously reported BLA or NDA-enabling study. Of the 30 labeling modifications supported by results of studies incorporating tumor response, the observed ORR ranged from 15.9-83.3%, with a median of 34%7. In the first-line setting, Ipi/Nivo resulted in responses in an awe-inspiring 100% of patients. Furthermore, although limited in sample size, 50 enrolled subjects is also comparable to many studies supporting efficacy labelling modifications in skin cancer. There have been 62 studies with less than 100 subjects and 8 with 50 or less (range = 12-1127)7. In our opinion, the data presented by Kim et al. unequivocally establishes activity of ipilimumab/nivolumab in MCC. Moreover, the risk profile is appropriate for the disease context and observed efficacy. Given the importance of product labels in both informing clinicians and insurance coverage, the authors support a consideration of this data by the agency for a supplemental accelerated approval label of ipilimumab/nivolumab for advanced MCC in the first-line setting.\nIn the second-line setting, the study also provides rationale that ipi-nivo administered earlier in the course of the disease may offer more benefit. For example, a recent retrospective study (N=13) assessing real-world outcomes of ipi-nivo in ICI-refractory patients had an ORR of 0% but the majority of patients had an ECOG PS > 1 with advanced stage disease.8 . In the wake of an ORR of 31% in the phase II trial among the previous-ICI cohort, perhaps ipi-nivo up-front may become the standard of care for advanced MCC. Additional real-world studies, although limited by confounding and bias, may provide important supportive evidence of this claim. Currently, ipi-nivo in the second line may offer some to little benefit but this highlights the need for more therapeutic options for the refractory setting.\n\nThis site represents our opinions only.
