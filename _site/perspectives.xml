<h1>Background for the Study</h1>
<p>Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare cutaneous neuroendocrine carcinoma often associated with chronic ultraviolet light exposure, a suppressed or weakened immune system, and/or the Merkel Cell Polyoma Virus (MCPyV). This aggressive skin cancer has a high distant metastasis rate, associated with a poor prognosis.</p>
<p>The advent of immunotherapeutics and the regulatory approvals of anti-PD-L1 and anti-PD-1 agents for MCC have revolutionized the treatment landscape. Avelumab received an accelerated FDA approval for metastatic MCC in 2017. Pembrolizumab was approved by the FDA in 2018 for the treatment of recurrent, locally advanced, and metastatic MCC. Immunotherapy is associated with durable responses in MCC and pivotal trials reported an objective response rate (ORR) of 39.7% (95% CI 30.7-49.2) for avelumab in the first line setting and an ORR of 33% (95% CI 23.3–43.8) in the chemotherapy-refractory setting.<span class="citation" data-cites="kaufman2016avelumab"><sup>2</sup></span> <sup>,</sup><span class="citation" data-cites="sandra2021"><sup>3</sup></span> <sup>,</sup><span class="citation" data-cites="d2020avelumab"><sup>4</sup></span> . An ORR of 58% (95% CI 43.2–71.8) was observed with pembrolizumab in the first line setting.<span class="citation" data-cites="Nghiem2016"><sup>5</sup></span> While anti-PD-L1 and anti-PD-1 monotherapy have been established as the standard of care for the treatment of advanced MCC, there are few systemic therapy options for those patients who have primary or acquired resistance and fail anti-PD(L)-1 treatment. Therefore, evaluating combination ipilimumab with nivolumab in patients who progress on anti-PD(L)-1 monotherapy as well as immunotherapy-naïve patients with MCC is warranted. Finally, since MCC is exceptionally radiosensitive and subablative hypofractionated radiotherapy may prime for anti-tumor immune responses, assessing combination ipilimumab with nivolumab in immunotherapy-naïve and refractory patients with or without the addition of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is worthy of investigation.<span class="citation" data-cites="demaria2015role"><sup>6</sup></span></p>

<h1>Study Design</h1>
<p><img src="https://cutaneousoncology.io/perspectives/ipi_nivo_for_advanced_mcc/files/november_2022/Figure1.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>This study received funding from the company and patients were enrolled from the Moffitt Cancer Center and Ohio State University James Cancer Hospital &amp; Solove Research Institute. The investigators conducted an open-label, Phase II study with eligible patients randomized (1:1) to Group A or B, two experimental groups. Group A was designed to evaluate the clinical efficacy of combination ipilimumab plus nivolumab (Ipi/Nivo) in patients with unresectable, recurrent, or stage IV MCC and Group B was designed to determine the clinical efficacy of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) with combination Ipi/Nivo. Patients were stratified as ICI-naïve or following previous ICI failure (See Figure 1).</p>
<p>Subjects were administered 240 mg intravenous (IV) nivolumab every 2 weeks and IV ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks. Patients randomized to Group B also received SBRT to a minimum of one tumor/lesion site at a dose of 24 Gy (3 fractions). The primary endpoint was the ORR in all eligible randomized patients per immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (irRECIST). See the tables below for key inclusion and exclusion criteria and secondary and exploratory endpoints.</p>

<h1>Main Findings</h1>
<p>Responses were observed in 18/25 (72%) of the subjects enrolled in Group A and 12/23 (52%) of the Group B patients. No statistically significant difference was reported between the two experimental groups (p value = 0.26). Analysis of the pooled ‘ICI-naïve’ versus ‘previous-ICI’ cohorts showed that 100% (95% CI 82-100; 22/22 subjects) of the ICI-naïve patients experienced an objective response while only 31% (95% CI 15-52; 8/26 subjects) of the previous-ICI patients had an objective response. Reported adverse events (AEs) were attributed to combination Ipi/Nivo with minimal SBRT-AEs observed. Any-Grade AEs occurred in 90% (40/50) of the subjects and Grade III/IV AEs were reported in 40% (10/25) of Group A patients and 32% ( 8/25) of Group B patients.</p>

<h1>Discussion Points</h1>
<p>We began Journal Club on November 7<sup>th</sup>, 2022 by administering a poll among the attendees via <a href="https://www.polleverywhere.com/">poll everywhere</a>. Our goal was to conduct a brief survey before and after journal club discussions to determine the current practices of clinicians participating in the dialogue and whether review/discussion of the article would be ‘practice-changing.’ The following reflects the survey results of the poll administered at the start of the meeting:</p>

<p>The following reflects the survey results of the poll after our discussion and article review:</p>
<p><img src="https://cutaneousoncology.io/perspectives/ipi_nivo_for_advanced_mcc/files/november_2022/q5.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p><img src="https://cutaneousoncology.io/perspectives/ipi_nivo_for_advanced_mcc/files/november_2022/q6.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Survey results demonstrate that upon review and discussion of the article, the study is indeed “practice-changing” among the Cutaneous Oncology Interest Group Journal Club attendees. According to the poll, the vast majority of participants were not administering Ipi/Nivo for advanced MCC a year ago, and have never administered Ipi/Nivo as a first-line therapy for MCC. The post-discussion survey shows the majority of participants will change their treatment recommendations for MCC after review of the article, and are more likely now to recommend Ipi/Nivo in light of the data/results of the phase II trial. With an ORR of 100% in the ICI-naive cohort, potentially administering Ipi/Nivo in the first-line may be a reasonable management option moving forward. However, we must continue to weigh potential risks in the setting of increased toxicity with combination ICI versus monotherapy anti-PD(L)-1. Below, a table of the Grade III+ reported AEs from the avelumab, and pembrolizumab pivotal trials are listed alongside the grade III/IV AEs described in this study. Of note, the dosing regimen utilized in both Group A and B differs from that recommended for melanoma. Ipi was administered every 6 weeks at 1mg/kg with nivo every 2 weeks at 240mg and demonstrated clinical efficacy in MCC. This may likely be associated with reduced toxicity comparable to other dosing regimens, but appears higher than anti-PD(L)-1 mono therapy. However, direct comparisons across the trials with different numbers of enrolled patients and duration of therapies is cautioned (see Table below).</p>
<p><img src="https://cutaneousoncology.io/perspectives/ipi_nivo_for_advanced_mcc/files/november_2022/AEs.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>A favored suggestion amongst the group for future directions included a multi-center, randomized clinical trial evaluating monotherapy anti-PD(L)-1 versus Ipi/Nivo (first-line) for advanced MCC, to assess efficacy and toxicity differences across the different regimens. That said, participants acknowledged that large comparative trials remain difficult to conduct in rare diseases such as MCC. Indeed, the two therapies approved in MCC (avelumab and pembrolizumab) came via single arm, non-comparative studies, with overall limited sample sizes (n = 88 and n = 50, respectively). In this context, the question of whether the present study should be sufficient for additional labeling information for ipilimumab and nivolumab was raised. When viewed in the backdrop of the evolving regulatory landscape on cutaneous oncology, the current study shares many of the features of recent studies that have led to label modifications in skin cancer<span class="citation" data-cites="Miller2022"><sup>7</sup></span> . For example, an analysis of the evidence used to support labeled claims in skin cancer from 1949 to February 09, 2021 demonstrated that the most common endpoint incorporate some form of tumor response, such as ORR, used by Kim et al.&nbsp;Interestingly, the present study demonstrated a response rate that surpassed any previously reported BLA or NDA-enabling study. Of the 30 labeling modifications supported by results of studies incorporating tumor response, the observed ORR ranged from 15.9-83.3%, with a median of 34%<span class="citation" data-cites="Miller2022"><sup>7</sup></span>. In the first-line setting, Ipi/Nivo resulted in responses in an awe-inspiring 100% of patients. Furthermore, although limited in sample size, 50 enrolled subjects is also comparable to many studies supporting efficacy labelling modifications in skin cancer. There have been 62 studies with less than 100 subjects and 8 studies with 50 or fewer (range = 12-1127)<span class="citation" data-cites="Miller2022"><sup>7</sup></span>. In our opinion, the data presented by Kim et al.&nbsp;unequivocally establishes activity of ipilimumab/nivolumab in MCC. Moreover, the risk profile is appropriate for the disease context and observed efficacy. Given the importance of product labels in both informing clinicians and insurance coverage, the authors support a consideration of this data by the agency for a supplemental accelerated approval label of ipilimumab/nivolumab for advanced MCC in the first-line setting.</p>
<p>In the second-line setting, the study also provides rationale that Ipi/Nivo administered earlier in the course of the disease may offer more benefit. For example, a recent retrospective study (N=13) assessing real-world outcomes of Ipi/Nivo in ICI-refractory patients had an ORR of 0% but the majority of patients had an ECOG PS &gt; 1 with advanced stage disease.<span class="citation" data-cites="shalhout2022retrospective"><sup>8</sup></span> . In the wake of an ORR of 31% in the phase II trial among the previous-ICI cohort, perhaps Ipi/Nivo up-front may become the standard of care for advanced MCC. Additional real-world studies, although limited by confounding and bias, may provide important supportive evidence of this claim. Currently, Ipi/Nivo in the second line may offer some to little benefit but this highlights the need for more therapeutic options for the refractory setting.</p>

<section id="background-for-the-study" class="level1">
<h1>Background for the Study</h1>
<p>Although the vast majority of cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (CSCC) are treated and cured with local destruction or surgical excision, a subset of patients have poor outcomes, including regional, nodal and distant metastases. Approximately 6% of patients with CSCC will go on to develop nodal or distant disease, resulting in a mortality of 1.5-2%<span class="citation" data-cites="patel2021"><sup>2</sup></span>;<span class="citation" data-cites="Thompson2016"><sup>3</sup></span>. Consequently, there is an unmet need to find alternative treatment strategies to improve outcomes in patients with high-risk CSCC.</p>
<p>Recently, clinical trial data has lead to the approval of immune checkpoint inhibitors for locally advanced and metastatic CSCC<span class="citation" data-cites="Migden2018"><sup>4</sup></span>;<span class="citation" data-cites="Grob2020"><sup>5</sup></span> . Objective response rates for advanced disease ranging from 46-51% and 35-50% in EMPOWER-CSCC-1 and KEYNOTE-629, respectively, led to the hypotheses tested by Gross et al.&nbsp;that pre-operative anti-PD-1 would improve pathological response rates at the time of surgical excision.</p>
</section>
<section id="study-design" class="level1">
<h1>Study Design</h1>
<p>The investigators conducted a company-sponsored, phase 2, multi-center, non-randomized study involving 79 patients with high-risk disease. Patients were eligible if they had resectable Stage II or greater disease. Of note, only Stage II patients with primary lesions &gt;3 cm were eligible. Subjects received up to four doses of cemiplimab 350 mg every three weeks, followed by surgical resection. The primary endpoint of the study was a pathological complete response (pCR) rate. The null hypotheses was a pCR rate of 25%. Following surgery, investigators were allowed to decide on a post-operative course that included observation, adjuvant radiotherapy or continued cemiplimab.</p>
</section>
<section id="main-findings" class="level1">
<h1>Main Findings</h1>
<p>Pathological complete responses were seen in 40 patients (51%), with another 10 patients exhibiting a major pathological response (defined as &lt;10% viable tumor cells seen on the specimen). Adverse events (AEs) were seen in 87% of patients, with grade three or greater AEs occurring in 18% of patients. Four patients died during the study.</p>
</section>
<section id="discussion-points" class="level1">
<h1>Discussion Points</h1>
<p>The consensus amongst the Interest Group was that this study is indeed practice-changing. A few participants were already incorporating pre-operative immunecheckpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy for some of their highest-risk patients prior the publication of these results. Other participants that were primarily using ICI therapy per the FDA indications (e.g.&nbsp;locally advanced or metastatic disease) stated that they would consider implementing ICI earlier in the disease journey as a result of this study. Participants, however, stressed the importance of assessing the benefit-to-risk ratio. The absolute risk of poor outcomes for various stages of disease studied in this population varies and, in many cases, remain incompletely clarified. This may be due to CSCC not being part of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program. Therefore prognostic estimates of local recurrence, nodal and distant metastases, as well as disease-specific death, have come largely from single-institution datasets and are limited. For example, a 2019 study by Ruiz et al.&nbsp;evaluated the prognosis of 459 patients at BWH<span class="citation" data-cites="ruiz2019"><sup>6</sup></span> . The 10-year cumulative incidence (CIN) rate of local recurrence (LR), nodal metastases (NM) and disease-specific death (DSD) for AJCC Stage II disease was 15.8, 12.2 and 7.6%, respectively in the 36 tumors evaluated. For the 119 T3 tumors (e.g.&nbsp;AJCC Stage III), the 10-year CIN rates for LR, NM and DSD were 19.7, 14.1 and 9.3%, respectively.</p>
<p>Thus the benefits of pre-operative ICI must be weighed in the setting of toxicity. The current study had 4 fatalities, an unusually high proportion, given 79 total subjects. Typical estimated rates of ICI-related mortality are 1:200. Although only one subject’s death was considered possibly related to treatment, all four died of cardiac-related events. These subjects were advanced in age (73, 82, 85 and 93 years old) and had underlying heart disease; thus, making attributions of treatment relatedness challenging. However, we must continue to be vigilant of possible treatment-related effects of ICI therapy given the advanced age of the CSCC population and emerging data that anti-PD-1 therapies may be associated with increases in cardiovascular events and atherosclerotic plaque disruption<span class="citation" data-cites="Drobni2020"><sup>7</sup></span>.</p>
<p>In the wake of this impactful study, several questions remain. These include the optimal number of doses of pre-operative ICI. Comparable path CR rates were observed in a pilot study two pre-operative doses of cemiplimab in Stage II-IV CSCC<span class="citation" data-cites="Ferrarotto2021"><sup>8</sup></span> . Twenty-two percent of the subjects in the study did not received all four doses and 11% did not undergo surgery in the protocol-specified window. Thus, identifying the optimal number of pre-opreative doses of ICI therapy remains critical. In addition, understanding the clinical benefit of pre-operative ICI in some of the most at-risk patients is necessary, including those with incompetent immune systems. Furthermore, integrating pre-operative ICIs into a treatment landscape of post-operative systemic therapy, adjuvant radiation therapy or salvage treatment upon disease recurrence remains important unmet need.</p>
